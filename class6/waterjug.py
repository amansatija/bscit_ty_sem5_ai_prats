# Letâ€™s unpack:
# Empty jug1: (0, amt2)
# Empty jug2: (amt1, 0)
# Fill jug1: (jug1, amt2)
# Fill jug2: (amt1, jug2)
# Pour jug2 â†’ jug1: # transfer as much as possible into jug1, until jug1 full or jug2 empty
# Pour jug1 â†’ jug2: # transfer as much as possible into jug2, until jug2 full or jug1 empty


# # further details 
# 1. waterJugSolver(0, amt2) â†’ Empty jug1
# We set jug1 to 0 (empty), leave jug2 unchanged.
# Example: (3, 2) â†’ (0, 2).

# 2. waterJugSolver(amt1, 0) â†’ Empty jug2
# We set jug2 to 0, leave jug1 unchanged.
# Example: (3, 2) â†’ (3, 0).

# 3. waterJugSolver(jug1, amt2) â†’ Fill jug1
# We fill jug1 completely to capacity (jug1 = 4 in this problem).
# Example: (1, 2) â†’ (4, 2).

# 4. waterJugSolver(amt1, jug2) â†’ Fill jug2
# We fill jug2 completely to capacity (jug2 = 3).
# Example: (2, 0) â†’ (2, 3).

# 5. waterJugSolver(amt1 + min(amt2, (jug1 - amt1)), amt2 - min(amt2, (jug1 - amt1))) â†’ Pour jug2 â†’ jug1
# This is the pouring logic:
# jug1 - amt1 = remaining space in jug1.
# min(amt2, (jug1 - amt1)) = how much water we can actually pour (canâ€™t pour more than jug2 has, and canâ€™t exceed jug1â€™s capacity).
# New jug1 = amt1 + poured
# New jug2 = amt2 - poured
# Example: (2, 3) with jug1 capacity 4 â†’
# Jug1 space = 4 - 2 = 2
# Jug2 has 3, so pour = min(3, 2) = 2
# New state = (2+2, 3-2) = (4, 1) âœ…

# 6. waterJugSolver(amt1 - min(amt1, (jug2 - amt2)), amt2 + min(amt1, (jug2 - amt2))) â†’ Pour jug1 â†’ jug2
# Symmetric to step 5 but pour in the opposite direction:
# jug2 - amt2 = remaining space in jug2.
# min(amt1, (jug2 - amt2)) = how much can be poured.
# New jug1 = amt1 - poured
# New jug2 = amt2 + poured
# Example: (3, 1) with jug2 capacity 3 â†’
# Jug2 space = 3 - 1 = 2
# Jug1 has 3, so pour = min(3, 2) = 2
# New state = (3-2, 1+2) = (1, 3) âœ…


# ðŸ”„ Why the or chain?
# Each recursive call returns True if it finds the goal, False otherwise.
# The chain:
# call1 or call2 or call3 ...

# means: try action 1; if it doesnâ€™t solve the problem, try action 2; keep going until one succeeds.
# âœ… So in summary:
# (1â€“4): Empty/fill operations
# (5â€“6): Pour operations
# Together, these cover all possible valid actions in the water jug puzzle.
