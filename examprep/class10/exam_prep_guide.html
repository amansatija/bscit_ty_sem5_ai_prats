Java NIO non- blocking mode allows the thread to request writing data to a channel, but not wait for it to be fully written. The thread is allowed to go on and do something else in a mean time.  java NIO is buffer oriented I/O approach. Data is read into a buffer from which it is further processed using a channel. In NIO we deal with the channel and buffer for I/O operation.  The major difference between a channel and a stream is:  A stream can be used for one-way data transfer.  A channel provides a two-way data transfer facility. Therefore with the introduction of channel in java NIO, the non-blocking I/O operation can be performed. Let's see the interaction between channel, buffers, java program, data source and data sink: Channels: In Java NIO, the channel is a medium that transports the data efficiently between the entity and byte buffers. It reads the data from an entity and places it inside buffer blocks for consumption. Channels act as gateway provided by java NIO to access the I/O mechanism. Usually channels have one-to-one relationship with operating system file descriptor for providing the platform independence operational feature.

                    <h5>Answer:</h5>
                    <p>Java EE components are written in the Java programming language and compiled in the same way as any Java programming language program. The difference when you work with the Java EE platform, is Java EE components are assembled into a Java EE application, verified that they are well-formed and in compliance with the Java EE specification, and deployed to production where they are run and managed by the Java EE server. Java EE Architecture: Normally, thin-client multitiered applications are hard to write because they involve many lines of intricate code to handle transaction and state management, multithreading, resource pooling, and other complex low-level details. The component-based and platform-independent Java EE architecture makes Java EE applications easy to write because business logic is organized into reusable components and the Java EE server provides underlying services in the form of a container for every component type. Because you do not have to develop these services yourself, you are free to concentrate on solving the business problem at hand. Containers and Services: Component are installed in their containers during deployment and are the interface between a component and the low-level platform-specific functionality that supports the component. Before a web, enterprise bean, or application client component can be executed, it must be assembled into a Java EE application and deployed into its container. The assembly process involves specifying container settings for each component in the Java EE application and for the Java EE application itself. Container settings customize the underlying support provided by the Java EE Server, which include services such as security, transaction management, Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) lookups, and remote connectivity. Here are some of the highlights:  The Java EE security model lets you configure a web component or enterprise bean so system resources are accessed only by authorized users. MUQuestionPapers.com 1  The Java EE transaction model lets you specify relationships among methods that make up a single transaction so all methods in one transaction are treated as a single unit. Container Types: The deployment process installs Java EE application components in the following types of Java EE containers.  An Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) container manages the execution of all enterprise beans for one Java EE application. Enterprise beans and their container run on the Java EE server.  A web container manages the execution of all JSP page and servlet components for one Java EE application. Web components and their container run on the Java EE server.  An application client container manages the execution of all application client components for one Java EE application. Application clients and their container run on the client machine.  An applet container is the web browser and Java Plug-in combination running on the client machine. b)</p>

Java EE Architecture: Normally, thin-client multitiered applications are hard to write because they involve many lines of intricate code to handle transaction and state management, multithreading, resource pooling, and other complex low-level details. The component-based and platform-independent Java EE architecture makes Java EE applications easy to write because business logic is organized into reusable components and the Java EE server provides underlying services in the form of a container for every component type. Because you do not have to develop these services yourself, you are free to concentrate on solving the business problem at hand. Containers and Services: Component are installed in their containers during deployment and are the interface between a component and the low-level platform-specific functionality that supports the component. Before a web, enterprise bean, or application client component can be executed, it must be assembled into a Java EE application and deployed into its container. The assembly process involves specifying container settings for each component in the Java EE application and for the Java EE application itself. Container settings customize the underlying support provided by the Java EE Server, which include services such as security, transaction management, Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) lookups, and remote connectivity. Here are some of the highlights:  The Java EE security model lets you configure a web component or enterprise bean so system resources are accessed only by authorized users. MUQuestionPapers.com 1  The Java EE transaction model lets you specify relationships among methods that make up a single transaction so all methods in one transaction are treated as a single unit. Container Types: The deployment process installs Java EE application components in the following types of Java EE containers.  An Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) container manages the execution of all enterprise beans for one Java EE application. Enterprise beans and their container run on the Java EE server.  A web container manages the execution of all JSP page and servlet components for one Java EE application. Web components and their container run on the Java EE server.  An application client container manages the execution of all application client components for one Java EE application. Application clients and their container run on the client machine.  An applet container is the web browser and Java Plug-in combination running on the client machine. b) Classify the EE Containers. Explain. (5) Java EE Containers: Normally, thin-client multitier applications are hard to write because they involve many lines of intricate code to handle transaction and state management, multithreading, resource pooling, and other complex low-level details. The component-based and platform-independent Java EE architecture makes Java EE applications easy to write because business logic is organized into reusable components. In addition, the Java EE server provides underlying services in the form of a container for every component type. Because you do not have to develop these services yourself, you are free to concentrate on solving the business problem at hand. Container Services: Containers are the interface between a component and the low-level platform specific functionality that supports the component. Before a web, enterprise bean, or application client component can be executed, it must be assembled into a Java EE module and deployed into its container. The Java EE security model lets you configure a web component or enterprise bean so that system resources are accessed only by authorized users.  The Java EE transaction model lets you specify relationships among methods that make up a single transaction so that all methods in one transaction are treated as a single unit.  JNDI lookup services provide a unified interface to multiple naming and directory services in the enterprise so that application components can access these services.  The Java EE remote connectivity model manages low-level communications between clients and enterprise beans. After an enterprise bean is created, a client invokes methods on it as if it were in the same virtual machine. Container Types:  Java EE server: The runtime portion of a Java EE product. A Java EE server provides EJB and web containers. MUQuestionPapers.com 2  Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) container: Manages the execution of enterprise beans for Java EE applications. Enterprise beans and their container run on the Java EE server.  Web container: Manages the execution of JSP page and servlet components for Java EE applications. Web components and their container run on the Java EE server.  Application client container: Manages the execution of application client components. Application clients and their container run on the client.  Applet container: Manages the execution of applets. Consists of a web browser and Java Plug-in running on the client together. The deployment process installs Java EE application components in the Java EE containers as illustrated in following Figure: c) Write a short note on javax.servlet package (5) Servlet API: The javax.servlet and javax.servlet.http packages represent interfaces and classes for servlet api. The javax.servlet package contains many interfaces and classes that are used by the servlet or web container. These are not specific to any protocol. The javax.servlet.http package contains interfaces and classes that are responsible for http requests only. Let's see what are the interfaces of javax.servlet package. Interfaces in javax.servlet package There are many interfaces in javax.servlet package. They are as follows: 1. Servlet 2. ServletConfig 3. ServletRequest 4. ServletContext 5. ServletResponse 6. SingleThreadModel 7. RequestDispatcher 8. Filter • Classes in javax.servlet package There are many classes in javax.servlet package. They are as follows: 1.GenericServlet 2.ServletContextEvent MUQuestionPapers.com 3 3.ServletInputStream 4.ServletRequestAttributeEvent 5.ServletOutputStream 6.ServletContextAttributeEvent 7.ServletRequestWrapper 8.ServletException 9.ServletResponseWrapper 10.ServletRequestEvent ServletRequestEvent • Interfaces in javax.servlet.http package: There are many interfaces in javax.servlet.http package. They are as follows: 1. HttpServletRequest 2. HttpSessionAttributeListener 3. HttpServletResponse 4. HttpSessionBindingListener 5. HttpSession 6. HttpSessionActivationListener 7. HttpSessionListener • Classes in javax.servlet.http package: There are many classes in javax.servlet.http package. They are as follows: 1. HttpServlet 2. Cookie 3. HttpServletRequestWrapper 4. HttpServletResponseWrapper 5. HttpSessionEvent 6. HttpSessionBindingEvent d)Explain the lifecycle of a servlet application. MUQuestionPapers.com 4 (5) It describes how a servlet is : • Loaded • Instantiated • Initialized • Services requests • Destroyed • Finally garbage collected Initialization: • • • • • • • • • • • • • • In order to initialize a servlet, the servlet engine first locates its class. The servlet engine uses the usual java class loading facilities to load the servlet class into the JVM. Once loaded, the servlet engine instantiates an instance of that servlet. Then it calls the init(ServletConfig config) method. init() is called immediately after the server constructs the object. Declaration : public void init(SerlvetConfig config) throws ServletException During initialization , servlet has access to two objects: ServletConfig and ServletConext Following tasks can be implemented by overridding init() of Servlet: Reading initializing parameters using ServletConfig object. Reading configuration data from persistent resources Initializing a database driver Opening a JDBC connection Writing log information Runtime: • • • • • • After the server loads and initializes the servlet, it is able to handle client requests. It process them in service() method. Each client request is run in separate thread. Declaration: public void service(ServletRequest req, ServletResponse res) throws ServletException,IOException Request object helps in accessing the original request data and response object provides methods that helps the servlet to build a response. Destruction: • • • • • • When instructed to unload the servlet, servlet engine calls the detroy(). Declaration : public void destroy() The method runs once. Tasks performed by the method are: Synchronizing cleanup tasks Informing other application that servlet is no longer in service. MUQuestionPapers.com 5 e) Explain the architecture of JDBC. (5) JDBC Architecture : The JDBC API supports both two-tier and three-tier processing models for database access but in general, JDBC Architecture consists of two layers • JDBC API: This provides the application-to-JDBC Manager connection. • JDBC Driver API: This supports the JDBC Manager-to-Driver Connection. The JDBC API uses a driver manager and database-specific drivers to provide transparent connectivity to heterogeneous databases. The JDBC driver manager ensures that the correct driver is used to access each data source. The driver manager is capable of supporting multiple concurrent drivers connected to multiple heterogeneous databases. Following is the architectural diagram, which shows the location of the driver manager with respect to the JDBC drivers and the Java application f) Explain the architecture of Java Enterprise Application. (5)  java EE Application Components: Java EE applications are made up of components. A Java EE component is a selfcontained functional software unit that is assembled into a Java EE application with its related classes and files and communicates with other components. The Java EE specification defines the following Java EE components:  Application clients and applets are client components.  Java Servlet and JavaServer Pages (JSP) technology components are web components.  Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) components (enterprise beans) are business components. Java EE components are written in the Java programming language and compiled in the same way as any Java programming language program. The difference when you work with the Java EE platform, is Java EE components are assembled into a Java EE application, verified that they are well-formed and in compliance with the Java EE specification, and deployed to production where they are run and managed by the Java EE server.

                    <p>(5) A JDBC RowSet object holds tabular data in a way that makes it more flexible and easier to use than a result set. Oracle has defined five RowSet interfaces for some of the more popular uses of a RowSet, and standard reference are available for these RowSet interfaces. These versions of the RowSet interface and their implementations have been provided as a convenience for programmers. Programmers are free to write their own versions of the javax.sql.RowSet interface, to extend the implementations of the five RowSet interfaces, or to write their own implementations. The following interfaces extend RowSet interface: • JdbcRowSet: It is a connected rowset that makes a JDBC driver look like a JavaBeans component. • CachedRowSet: it is a container for rows of data that caches its rows in memory, which makes it possible to operate without always being connected to its data source. • WebRowSet: It is a disconnected rowset that caches its data in memory in the same manner as a CachedRowSet object. As a consequence, a WebRowSet object fills a real need by making it easy for web services to send and receive data from a database in the form of an XML document. • JoinRowSet: It provides a mechanism for combining related data from different RowSet objects into one JoinRowSet object, which represents an SQL JOIN . In other words, a JoinRowSet object acts as a container for the data from RowSet objects that form an SQL JOIN relationship. • FilteredRowSet: It provides the reference implementation which may be extended if required. Alternatively, a vendor is free to implement its own version by implementing this interface. Q2 Attempt any three of the following: (15) a)</p>

                    <p>(5) RequestDispatcher interface : • • • • • • • It is used for dispatching a request. It encapsulates a reference to a web resource located at the path specified within the scope of the same servlet context. It defines an object, which receives requests from a visitor’s browser and sends the requests to any other resource on the web server. The servlet engine creates the RequestDispatcher object, which is used as a wrapper around a web server resource located through the path specified or given by a particular name. We can get the object of RequestDispatcher interface by using the method: getRequestDispatcher(), there are two ways of using this method: javax.servlet.ServletContext.getRequestDispatcher() javax.servlet.ServletRequest.getRequestDispatcher() MUQuestionPapers.com 4 Methods of RequestDispatcher : • • This interface has two methods: include() : it allows including the content produced by another resource such as servlet, JSP or HTML file in the calling servlet’s response. • forward() : it allows forwarding the request to another servlet, a JSP or HTML page on the server. This resource then take over the responsibility for producing the response. It is useful when one servlet does some preliminary processing of a request and wants to let another object complete the generation of the response. • b)</p>

                    <h5>Answer:</h5>
                    <p>(5) The following steps explain how the web server creates the Webpage using JSP – 1. As with a normal page, your browser sends an HTTP request to the web server. 2. The web server recognizes that the HTTP request is for a JSP page and forwards it to a JSP engine. This is done by using the URL or JSP page which ends with .jsp instead of .html. 3. The JSP engine loads the JSP page from disk and converts it into a servlet content. This conversion is very simple in which all template text is converted to println( ) statements and all JSP elements are converted to Java code. This code implements the corresponding dynamic behavior of the page. 4. The JSP engine compiles the servlet into an executable class and forwards the original request to a servlet engine. 5. A part of the web server called the servlet engine loads the Servlet class and executes it. During execution, the servlet produces an output in HTML format. The output is further passed on to the web server by the servlet engine inside an HTTP response. 6. The web server forwards the HTTP response to your browser in terms of static HTML content. Finally, the web browser handles the dynamically-generated HTML page inside the HTTP response exactly as if it were a static page. MUQuestionPapers.com 10 b)</p>

Finally, the web browser handles the dynamically-generated HTML page inside the HTTP response exactly as if it were a static page. MUQuestionPapers.com 10 b)</p>

                    <p>(5) The <jsp: useBean> element is used to access the bean in jsp. This element instantiates an object of the bean class specified by class name & binds it to an object with the name specified. A new object is instantiated only if only if there is no existing one with the same ID & scope. The useBean action creates a Java object in a specified scope. The object is also made available in the current JSP page as a scripting variable. The syntax for the useBean action is: <jsp:useBean id= "beanobjname" class="className " | beanName=―className " scope="page | request | session | application‖ > </jsp:useBean> The setProperty action can be used in conjunction with the useBean action to set the properties of a bean. We can even get the container to populate the bean properties from the request parameters without specifying the property names. In such cases the container will match the bean property names with the request parameter names. The syntax for the setProperty action is shown below: <jsp:setProperty name=―BeanObj" property="*" | property="propertyName" | [param="paramName" value="value―] /> The getProperty action can be used in conjunction with the useBean action to get the value of the properties of the bean defined by the useBean action. For example: <jsp:getProperty name=―BeanObj" property="firstName"/> c)</p>

                    <p>(5) An EJB JAR file is portable and can be used for various applications. EJB 3.0 required packaging:      Web application in a WAR file – Web application archive EJB’s package in a JAR file – java archive WAR and JAR files into an EAR file – Enterprise application archive To assemble a Java EE application, package one or more modules into an EAR file, the archive file that holds the application. When deploying the EAR file that contains the enterprise bean's EJB JAR file, you also deploy the enterprise bean to GlassFish Server. You can also deploy an EJB JAR that is not contained in an EAR file. Figure shows the contents of an EJB JAR file. MUQuestionPapers.com 15 Packaging Enterprise Beans in WAR Modules        Enterprise beans often provide the business logic of a web application. In these cases, packaging the enterprise bean within the web application's WAR module simplifies deployment and application organization. To include enterprise bean class files in a WAR module, the class files should be in the WEB-INF/classes directory. To include a JAR file that contains enterprise beans in a WAR module, add the JAR to the WEB-INF/lib directory of the WAR module. WAR modules that contain enterprise beans do not require an ejb-jar.xml deployment descriptor. If the application uses ejb-jar.xml, it must be located in the WAR module's WEB-INF directory. For example, suppose that a web application consists of a shopping cart enterprise bean, a credit card–processing enterprise bean, and a Java servlet front end. The shopping cart bean exposes a local, no-interface view and is defined as follows: package com.example.cart; @Stateless public class CartBean { ... } The credit card–processing bean is packaged within its own JAR file, cc.jar, exposes a local, no-interface view, and is defined as follows: package com.example.cc; @Stateless public class CreditCardBean { ... } The servlet, com.example.web.StoreServlet, handles the web front end and uses both CartBean and CreditCardBean. The WAR module layout for this application is as follows: WEB-INF/classes/com/example/cart/CartBean.class WEB-INF/classes/com/example/web/StoreServlet WEB-INF/lib/cc.jar WEB-INF/ejb-jar.xml WEB-INF/web.xml c)</p>

                    <p>(5) Java Persistence API with specification: 1. Java Persistence API is a specification, which is released under Java EE 5 specification. 2. It is neither an implementation nor a product. Hence, it cannot be used as it is for persistence. It needs an ORM implementation to work with and persist Java Objects. 3. Technically, JPA is just a set of interfaces [a Specification] and thus requires an implementation. MUQuestionPapers.com 20 4. All specifications require vendors or open source projects to implement them. Using JPA therefore requires picking up an implementation [ORM tool such as Hibernate, Toplink, OpenJPA or any other ORM that implements JPA]. 5. JPA defines the interface that an implementation has to implement. 6. The whole point of having a standard interface is that users can, in principle, switch between implementations of JPA without changing their code. 7. This way, JPA helps prevent Vendor Lock-In by relying on a strict specification such as JDO and EJB 2.x entities. 8. Currently most of the persistence vendors[ORM tool providers] have released implementations of JPA. 9. Since, the Java Persistence code spec covers several persistence frameworks into a single API, an application written using JPA will work across several implementations [Hibernate, Toplink and so on]. This is very useful, especially when, development begins using the free open source ORM implementations and later on when the need arises, the open source implementation is swapped with a commercial ORM implementation. The switch happens without changing the application code spec. b)</p>

The switch happens without changing the application code spec. b)</p>

                    <p>com 1   The Application Client Container: It provides services required for the execution of application client components. Application clients and their container run on the client. It includes a set of Java classes and libraries, security management, naming services to Java SE applications etc. Applet container: Applet container is provided by the majority of the web browsers for the execution of Applet. The container prevents any code downloaded to the local computer from accessing local system resources such as processes or files. c) What are the alternatives to CGI? Explain in detail. (5) CGI programs provided a relatively simple way to create Web applications that accepts user input, queries a database and returns relevant results back to the Web browser. But there are certain disadvantages of using CGI like Lack of scalability and reduced speed Platform dependent, A process consumes a lot of server side resources in multi-user situation, Difficult for beginners to program modules in this environment, Less efficient etc. The alternatives to CGI is Servlets. Servlets  Are loaded into memory once and run from memory thereafter  Are created as a thread, not as a process  Are powerful object-oriented abstraction of HTTP  Are portable across multiple platforms  Are simple to design and implement  Accept client’s requests and efficiently run the requests within the secure and reliable scope of a Java Virtual Machine  Are robust and scalable CGI Replacement  Provide direct Database access using different Database drivers.  Are supported by several Web Servers. d) Write a short note on Part and WebConnection interfaces. (5) Part interface: It represents a part or form item that was received within a multipart/formdata POST request. Its frequently used methods are: InputStream getInputStream()throws IOException Gets the content of this part as an InputStream String getSubmittedFileName() Gets the file name specified by the client WebConnection interface: This interface encapsulates the connection for an upgrade request. It allows the protocol handler to send service requests and status queries to the container. It has following two methods: MUQuestionPapers.com 2 ServletInputStream getInputStream() throws IOException Returns an input stream for this web connection for reading binary data. ServletOutputStream getOutputStream()throws IOException Returns an output stream for this web connection for writing binary data. e) Explain Deployment descriptor file with its elements. (5) The web.xml file is a standard Java EE deployment descriptor, specified in the Java Servlet specification It can be changed without making any change in the source code It is used to run the application The elements of web.xml deployment descriptor file are: I. <web-app> II. <servlet> III. <session-mapping> IV. <session-config> V. <welcome-file-list> 1. <web-app> All entries are wrapped within a pair of opening and closing <web-app> elements 2. <servlet> Used to register and configure Servlet details within the opening and closing of <servlet> elements <servlet-name> - defines the name of a servlet <servlet-class> - actual servlet class name 3. <session-mapping> It is used to define mapping between servlet and the corresponding url pattern <servlet-name> - name of the servlet <url-pattern> - corresponding url details 4. <session-config> Used to specify session information <session-timeout> - used to define session timeout in minutes 5. <welcome-file-list> It consists of a set of filenames when user accesses the path of a WAR subdirectory. It consists of: <welcome-file> - it consists of either index.html or index.jsp MUQuestionPapers.com 3 f) Explain RowSet and its type in JDBC. (5) A JDBC RowSet object holds tabular data in a way that makes it more flexible and easier to use than a result set. Oracle has defined five RowSet interfaces for some of the more popular uses of a RowSet, and standard reference are available for these RowSet interfaces. These versions of the RowSet interface and their implementations have been provided as a convenience for programmers. Programmers are free to write their own versions of the javax.sql.RowSet interface, to extend the implementations of the five RowSet interfaces, or to write their own implementations. The following interfaces extend RowSet interface: • JdbcRowSet: It is a connected rowset that makes a JDBC driver look like a JavaBeans component. • CachedRowSet: it is a container for rows of data that caches its rows in memory, which makes it possible to operate without always being connected to its data source. • WebRowSet: It is a disconnected rowset that caches its data in memory in the same manner as a CachedRowSet object. As a consequence, a WebRowSet object fills a real need by making it easy for web services to send and receive data from a database in the form of an XML document. • JoinRowSet: It provides a mechanism for combining related data from different RowSet objects into one JoinRowSet object, which represents an SQL JOIN . In other words, a JoinRowSet object acts as a container for the data from RowSet objects that form an SQL JOIN relationship. • FilteredRowSet: It provides the reference implementation which may be extended if required. Alternatively, a vendor is free to implement its own version by implementing this interface. Q2 Attempt any three of the following: (15) a) Explain methods of RequstDispatcher interface. (5) RequestDispatcher interface : • • • • • • • It is used for dispatching a request. It encapsulates a reference to a web resource located at the path specified within the scope of the same servlet context. It defines an object, which receives requests from a visitor’s browser and sends the requests to any other resource on the web server. The servlet engine creates the RequestDispatcher object, which is used as a wrapper around a web server resource located through the path specified or given by a particular name. We can get the object of RequestDispatcher interface by using the method: getRequestDispatcher(), there are two ways of using this method: javax.servlet.ServletContext.getRequestDispatcher() javax.servlet.ServletRequest.getRequestDispatcher() MUQuestionPapers.com 4 Methods of RequestDispatcher : • • This interface has two methods: include() : it allows including the content produced by another resource such as servlet, JSP or HTML file in the calling servlet’s response. • forward() : it allows forwarding the request to another servlet, a JSP or HTML page on the server. This resource then take over the responsibility for producing the response. It is useful when one servlet does some preliminary processing of a request and wants to let another object complete the generation of the response. • b) Explain setting, sending and reading of Cookie in Java servlet. (5) Cookie can be created using the following contructor: Cookie(String name, String value): Constructs a cookie with the specified name and value. A cookie is just a name-value attribute that is issued by the server and stored on a client machine. It is returned by the client whenever it is accessing a certain group of URLs on a specified server. Following methods are some methods belongs to Cookie class. MUQuestionPapers.com 5 Cookies are created, stored and fetched using following methods:  Cookie.setMaxAge(int expiry): sets the maximum age in seconds for this Cookie.  HttpServletResponse.addCookie(): Adds the specified cookie to the response. This method can be called multiple times to set more than one cookie.  HttpServletRequest.getCookies(): Returns an array containing all of the Cookie objects the client sent with this request c) What is session tracking? What are the ways to track the sessions? (5) HTTP is a stateless protocol that provides no way for a server to recognize that a sequence of request come from the same client. (not even IP Address). Following are various techniques for session tracking: 1) HTTPSession 2) Cookies 3) URL rewriting 4) Hidden form fields 1) HttpSession Interface : HttpSession Interface provides a way across more than one-page request or visit to a website and to store information about that user. With the help of the HttpSession interface, a session can be created between an HTTP client and an HTTP server. This session can persist for a specified time period, across more than one connection or page request from the user. A Servlet obtains an HttpSession object using HttpSession getSession(boolean) of HttpservetRequest. 2) Providing Continuity with Cookies : cookie is just a name-value attribute that is issued by the server and stored on a client machine. It is returned by the client whenever it is accessing a certain group of URLs on a specified server. Following methods are some methods belongs to Cookie class. A cookie is a small piece of data stored on the client-side which servers use when communicating with clients. Cookies are used to identify a client when sending a subsequent request. They can also be used for passing some data from one servlet to another. 3) Hidden Form Fields : A web server can send a hidden HTML form field along with a unique session ID as follows: <input type=”hidden” name=”city” value=”Mumbai”> This could be an effective way of keeping track of the session but clicking on a regular (<A HREF…>) hypertext link does not result in a form submission. MUQuestionPapers.com 6 4) URL Rewriting : There is an alternative way to send a cookie: URL Rewriting. The cookie data is appended to the URL. You should use URL rewriting only as a fallback for browsers that do not support cookies. d) Write a short note on creation and validation of sessions. (5) The following program explains how the session is created. It also explains that till whether the session is created for the first time or not. Also if it is used 10 times then it deletes the session object using its invalidate() method. import java.io.*; import javax.servlet.*; import javax.servlet.http.*; public class CalculationVisitServlet extends HttpServlet { // private static int counter; private int counter; public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException { response.setContentType("text/html"); PrintWriter out = response.getWriter(); HttpSession session=request.getSession(true); if(session.isNew()) { out.print("This is the first time you are visiting this page"); ++counter; } else { synchronized(this) { if(counter==10) { session.invalidate(); counter=0; request.getSession(false); } else out.print("You have visited this page "+(++counter)+ " times"); } } } } MUQuestionPapers.com 7 e) Which points are important while uploading a file? (5) Following points should be considered while uploading a file: Set encodiging type attribute as follows: enctype attribute of <form> tag multipart/form-data - No characters are encoded. text/plain- Spaces are converted to "+" symbols, but no special characters are encoded type attribute value in <input>tag type="file" let the user choose one or more files from their device storage. Once chosen, the files can be uploaded to a server using form submission Part getPart() Retrieve the name, store location, size, and content-type of the file File name=--------, StoreLocation=--------, size=--------bytes, isFormField=false, FieldName=filedetails File getSubmittedFileName() It returns the selected file name from the FileOpenWindow. @MultipartConfig We need to annotate File Upload handler servlet with MultipartConfig annotation to handle multipart/form-data requests that is used for uploading file to server. MultipartConfig annotation has following attributes: • fileSizeThreshold: We can specify the size threshold after which the file will be written to disk. The size value is in bytes, so 1024*1024*10 is 10 MB. • location: Directory where files will be stored by default, it’s default value is ―‖. • maxFileSize: Maximum size allowed to upload a file, it’s value is provided in bytes. It’s default value is -1L means unlimited. • maxRequestSize: Maximum size allowed for multipart/form-data request. Default value is 1L that means unlimited. Steps to write a program to upload a file • Allow browsing the file to upload it • Allows specifying the location where to upload it • Display the message indicating a successful file upload • Display the link to return back to upload more files MUQuestionPapers.com 8 f) Explain the working of Non-Blocking I/O. (5) Non-blocking I/O:      It is Buffer-oriented Channels are available for Non-blocking I/O operation Selectors are available for Non-blocking I/O operation Non blocking IO does not wait for the data to be read or write before returning. Java NIO non- blocking mode allows the thread to request writing data to a channel, but not wait for it to be fully written. The thread is allowed to go on and do something else in a mean time.  java NIO is buffer oriented I/O approach. Data is read into a buffer from which it is further processed using a channel. In NIO we deal with the channel and buffer for I/O operation.  The major difference between a channel and a stream is:  A stream can be used for one-way data transfer.  A channel provides a two-way data transfer facility. Therefore with the introduction of channel in java NIO, the non-blocking I/O operation can be performed. Let's see the interaction between channel, buffers, java program, data source and data sink: Channels: In Java NIO, the channel is a medium that transports the data efficiently between the entity and byte buffers. It reads the data from an entity and places it inside buffer blocks for consumption. Channels act as gateway provided by java NIO to access the I/O mechanism. Usually channels have one-to-one relationship with operating system file descriptor for providing the platform independence operational feature. MUQuestionPapers.com 9 Q3 Attempt any three of the following: (15) a) How JSP functions and executes? (5) The following steps explain how the web server creates the Webpage using JSP – 1. As with a normal page, your browser sends an HTTP request to the web server. 2. The web server recognizes that the HTTP request is for a JSP page and forwards it to a JSP engine. This is done by using the URL or JSP page which ends with .jsp instead of .html. 3. The JSP engine loads the JSP page from disk and converts it into a servlet content. This conversion is very simple in which all template text is converted to println( ) statements and all JSP elements are converted to Java code. This code implements the corresponding dynamic behavior of the page. 4. The JSP engine compiles the servlet into an executable class and forwards the original request to a servlet engine. 5. A part of the web server called the servlet engine loads the Servlet class and executes it. During execution, the servlet produces an output in HTML format. The output is further passed on to the web server by the servlet engine inside an HTTP response. 6. The web server forwards the HTTP response to your browser in terms of static HTML content. Finally, the web browser handles the dynamically-generated HTML page inside the HTTP response exactly as if it were a static page. MUQuestionPapers.com 10 b) How to set and access the properties of Java bean in JSP? (5) The <jsp: useBean> element is used to access the bean in jsp. This element instantiates an object of the bean class specified by class name & binds it to an object with the name specified. A new object is instantiated only if only if there is no existing one with the same ID & scope. The useBean action creates a Java object in a specified scope. The object is also made available in the current JSP page as a scripting variable. The syntax for the useBean action is: <jsp:useBean id= "beanobjname" class="className " | beanName=―className " scope="page | request | session | application‖ > </jsp:useBean> The setProperty action can be used in conjunction with the useBean action to set the properties of a bean. We can even get the container to populate the bean properties from the request parameters without specifying the property names. In such cases the container will match the bean property names with the request parameter names. The syntax for the setProperty action is shown below: <jsp:setProperty name=―BeanObj" property="*" | property="propertyName" | [param="paramName" value="value―] /> The getProperty action can be used in conjunction with the useBean action to get the value of the properties of the bean defined by the useBean action. For example: <jsp:getProperty name=―BeanObj" property="firstName"/> c) What are the types of expressions in EL? (5) The Expression Language (EL) simplifies the accessibility of data stored in the Java Bean component, and other objects like request, session, application etc. There are many implicit objects, operators and reserve words in EL. It can be used for the following cases: To fetch the parameter from another jsp file as: ${ param.name } To perform arithmetic operators: e.g. 5*5+4: ${5*5+4} To perform logical operator as: true and true: ${true and true} To perform relational operator as: 3.2>=2: ${3.2>=2} To perform conditional operator as: The result of 10>2 is: "${(10>1)?'greater':'lesser'}" To perform empty operator as: The Value for the Empty operator is:: ${empty ""}<br> MUQuestionPapers.com 11 Types of Expressions • The unified EL provides 2 types of expressions: – Value Expression – Method Expression  Value Expression: It is further categorized as: • Rvalue expressions: can only read data, but cannot write data. Expressions that use immediate evaluation syntax are always rvalue expressions. • Lvalue expressions: can read and write data. Expressions that use deferred evaluation syntax can act as both rvalue and lvalue expressions.  Method Expressions: • A JSF component uses method expressions, Which in turn invokes methods that do some processing on behalf of the component element. • For std. components, these methods are necessary for handling events that the components generates as well as validating component data.  Using EL Expressions: It can be used in 2 situations: As attribute values in std. and custom actions. In template text such as HTML or non-JSP elements, in the JSP file. d) Write a short note on restriction, projection and partitioning operators in EL. (5) Restriction operator – where: Iterates over the source sequence and yields those elements for which the predicate function returns true. The predicate function accepts two arguments: The first one represents the element to test The second, if present, represents the zero-based index of the element within the source sequence. e.g. employees.where(e->e.salary >=10000) projection operator - select: Iterates over the source sequence and yields the results of evaluating the selector Lambda for each element. The selector accepts two arguments: The first one represents the element to process The second, if present, represents the zero-based index of the element within the source sequence. E.g. employees.select(e->e.EmployeeName) partitioning operator - take: Iterates over the source sequence and yields a given number of elements from a sequence and then skips the remainder of the sequence. e.g. employees.take(100) MUQuestionPapers.com 12 partitioning operator - skip: Iterates over the source sequence and skips a given number of elements from a sequence and then yields the remainder of the sequence. e.g. employees.skip(2) e) Explain conditional or flow control statements in XML Tag Library with example. (5) The <x:if> tag is used for evaluating the test XPath expression. It is a simple conditional tag which is used for evaluating its body if the supplied condition is true. The syntax used for including the <x:if> tag is: <x:if attributes> body content </x:if> <%@ taglib prefix="c" uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core" %> <%@ taglib prefix="x" uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/xml" %> <html> <head> <title>x:if Tags</title> </head> <body> <h2>Vegetable Information:</h2> <c:set var="vegetables"> <vegetables> <vegetable> <name>onion</name> <price>40</price> </vegetable> <vegetable> <name>Potato</name> <price>30</price> </vegetable> </vegetables> </c:set> <x:parse xml="${vegetables}" var="output"/> <x:if select="$output/vegetables/vegetable/price < 100"> Vegetables prices are very low. </x:if> </body> </html> MUQuestionPapers.com 13 f) How to query and update data in JSTL? (5) The <sql:query> tag is used for executing the SQL query defined in its sql attribute or the body. It is used to execute an SQL SELECT statement and saves the result in scoped variable. Example: <sql:query dataSource="${db}" var="rs"> SELECT * from Students; </sql:query> The <sql:update> tag is used for executing the SQL DML query defined in its sql attribute or in the tag body. It may be SQL UPDATE, INSERT or DELETE statements. Example: <sql:update dataSource="${db}" var="count"> INSERT INTO Students VALUES (154,'Nasreen', 'jaha', 25); </sql:update> Q4 Attempt any three of the following: (15) a) Write a short note on enterprise bean server and enterprise bean. (5) enterprise bean server: • It is a component transaction server. • It supports the EJB server side component model fro developing and deploying distributed enterprise level applications in a multi-tiered environment. • It provides: • • • The framework for creating, deploying and managing middle-tier business logic. • An environment that allows the execution of applications developed using EJB components. In a three-tier environment: • The client provides the user interface logic • The business rules are separated to the middle tier • The database is the information repository An EJB server takes care of: • Managing and coordinating the allocation of resources to the applications MUQuestionPapers.com 14 • Security • Threads, Connection pooling enterprise bean: • It is a server-side component that encapsulates the code that fulfills the purpose of the application. • They can be combined with other components and rapidly produce a custom application. • The main purpose of introducing EJB was for building distributed components. • It was designed to solve all the issues n complexities of CORBA. • This technology is powerful n easy. It helps developers to build business applications that support very large no. of user simultaneously. • The EJB components can be assembled and reassembled into different distributed applications as per the requirements. b) Describe packaging of enterprise beans in JAR and WAR modules. (5) An EJB JAR file is portable and can be used for various applications. EJB 3.0 required packaging:      Web application in a WAR file – Web application archive EJB’s package in a JAR file – java archive WAR and JAR files into an EAR file – Enterprise application archive To assemble a Java EE application, package one or more modules into an EAR file, the archive file that holds the application. When deploying the EAR file that contains the enterprise bean's EJB JAR file, you also deploy the enterprise bean to GlassFish Server. You can also deploy an EJB JAR that is not contained in an EAR file. Figure shows the contents of an EJB JAR file. MUQuestionPapers.com 15 Packaging Enterprise Beans in WAR Modules        Enterprise beans often provide the business logic of a web application. In these cases, packaging the enterprise bean within the web application's WAR module simplifies deployment and application organization. To include enterprise bean class files in a WAR module, the class files should be in the WEB-INF/classes directory. To include a JAR file that contains enterprise beans in a WAR module, add the JAR to the WEB-INF/lib directory of the WAR module. WAR modules that contain enterprise beans do not require an ejb-jar.xml deployment descriptor. If the application uses ejb-jar.xml, it must be located in the WAR module's WEB-INF directory. For example, suppose that a web application consists of a shopping cart enterprise bean, a credit card–processing enterprise bean, and a Java servlet front end. The shopping cart bean exposes a local, no-interface view and is defined as follows: package com.example.cart; @Stateless public class CartBean { ... } The credit card–processing bean is packaged within its own JAR file, cc.jar, exposes a local, no-interface view, and is defined as follows: package com.example.cc; @Stateless public class CreditCardBean { ... } The servlet, com.example.web.StoreServlet, handles the web front end and uses both CartBean and CreditCardBean. The WAR module layout for this application is as follows: WEB-INF/classes/com/example/cart/CartBean.class WEB-INF/classes/com/example/web/StoreServlet WEB-INF/lib/cc.jar WEB-INF/ejb-jar.xml WEB-INF/web.xml c) How to access no-interface view and local business interface ? (5) • Accessing No-Interface View/Local Business/ Remote Business Interface: • Client access to an enterprise bean that exposes a local, no-interface view is accomplished either through dependency injection or JNDI lookup. • Client access using dependency injection: • • To obtain a reference to the no-interface view of an enterprise bean through dependency injection, use the javax.ejb.EJB annotation and specify the enterprise bean’s implementation class: @EJB Client access using JNDI lookup: MUQuestionPapers.com 16 • To obtain a reference to the no-interface view of an enterprise bean through JNDI lookup, use the javax.naming.InitialContext interface’s lookup method: IntialContext.lookup (); Method of accessing the enterprise Bean Remote Clients A remote client of an enterprise bean has the following traits (characteristics):      It can run on a different machine and a different Java virtual machine than the enterprise bean it accesses. It can be a web component, an application client, or another enterprise bean. To a remote client, the location of the enterprise bean is transparent. To create an enterprise bean that has remote access, you must code a remote interface and a home interface. The remote interface defines the business methods that are specific to the bean. The home interface defines the bean's life-cycle methods Local Clients A local client has these characteristics:      It must run in the same JVM as the enterprise bean it accesses. It can be a web component or another enterprise bean. To the local client, the location of the enterprise bean it accesses is not transparent. To build an enterprise bean that allows local access, you must code the local interface and the local home interface. The local interface defines the bean's business methods, and the local home interface defines its life-cycle. d) Write a short note on lifecycle of a Message Driven Bean with onMessage() method. (5) Lifecycle of Message Driven Bean: • The EJB container usually creates a pool of MDB instances. • For each instance, the EJB container performs these tasks: • If the MDB uses dependency injection, the container injects these references before instantiating the instance. • The container calls the method annotated @PostConstruct(if any). • Like a stateless session bean, a MDB is never passivated and it has only two states: • Nonexistent MUQuestionPapers.com 17 • Ready to receive messages Contain business logic for handling received messages to perform the operations such as • Computation/calculation • Initiating a step in a workflow • Storing data • Sending another message • Transfer data with another EJB for further processing • Are messages listeners, consuming messages from JMS destination such as queue or a topic • May invoke other EJB components to get some help onMessage() Method • In MDB, metadata annotations are used to specify the bean type. • In this case, @MessageDriven specifies the destination monitored by thie MDB. • The bean class need not implement the javax.ejb.MessageDrivenBean interface. • The onMessage() method is activated on the reception of messages sent by a client application to the corresponding JMS destination. MUQuestionPapers.com 18 e) How to define interceptor? What is the role of ArroundInvoke method? (5) Defining an Interceptor • Interceptor methods can be used to intercept either a business method or lifecycle event. • An interceptor that intercepts a business method is typically called an AroundInvoke method because it can be defined by annotating the method with an @AroundInvoke annotation. • An AroundInvoke method can be defined on: • • Enterprise bean class • Interceptor class An interceptor class is a normal java class. It does not need to extend any special class or implement any interface. AroundInvoke Method • It can be defined by either of the following methods: • Annotating the method with an @AroundInvoke annotation. • Using an element in the bean’s deployment descriptor. It must satisfy the following requirements: • One AroundInvoke method is allowed for each class. • It must have a no argument public constructor. • It must accept an javax.interceptor.InvocationCOntext object as an argument and return a java.lang.Object object. • It can throw any application exception that is specified in the business interface or any runtime exception. • It can be declared private, package private, protected or public. It must call InvocationContext.proceed() to signal its intention to continue the invocation. • Applying Interceptor • Adding an interceptor to an enterprise bean • Build and run the web application MUQuestionPapers.com 19 f) What is dataSource Resource Definition in Java EE? (5) • Java EE applications use datasource objects when they access relational databases through the JDBC API. • A datasource has a set of properties that identify the data source that it represents. • These properties include information such as : • The location of the database server • The name of the database • The network protocol to use to communicate with the server. • A datasource object also works with a JNDI naming service. • After registration the application can use the JNDI API to access that datasource object, which then can be used to connect to the datasource it represents. The name element uniquely identifies a DataSource and is registered with JNDI. The value specified in the name element begins with a namespace scope. Java EE includes the following scopes:       java:comp—Names in this namespace have per-component visibility. java:module—Names in this namespace are shared by all components in a module, for example, the EJB components defined in an a ejb-jar.xml file. java:app—Names in this namespace are shared by all components and modules in an application, for example, the application-client, web, and EJB components in an .ear file. java:global—Names in this namespace are shared by all the applications in the server. You can programmatically declare DataSource definitions using one of the following methods: Creating DataSource Resource Definitions Using Annotations Creating DataSource Resource Definition Using Deployment Descriptors Q5 Attempt any three of the following: (15) a) Explain Java Persistence API with specification. (5) Java Persistence API with specification: 1. Java Persistence API is a specification, which is released under Java EE 5 specification. 2. It is neither an implementation nor a product. Hence, it cannot be used as it is for persistence. It needs an ORM implementation to work with and persist Java Objects. 3. Technically, JPA is just a set of interfaces [a Specification] and thus requires an implementation. MUQuestionPapers.com 20 4. All specifications require vendors or open source projects to implement them. Using JPA therefore requires picking up an implementation [ORM tool such as Hibernate, Toplink, OpenJPA or any other ORM that implements JPA]. 5. JPA defines the interface that an implementation has to implement. 6. The whole point of having a standard interface is that users can, in principle, switch between implementations of JPA without changing their code. 7. This way, JPA helps prevent Vendor Lock-In by relying on a strict specification such as JDO and EJB 2.x entities. 8. Currently most of the persistence vendors[ORM tool providers] have released implementations of JPA. 9. Since, the Java Persistence code spec covers several persistence frameworks into a single API, an application written using JPA will work across several implementations [Hibernate, Toplink and so on]. This is very useful, especially when, development begins using the free open source ORM implementations and later on when the need arises, the open source implementation is swapped with a commercial ORM implementation. The switch happens without changing the application code spec. b) What is Impedance Mismatch? How it can be solved? (5) First problem, what if we need to modify the design of our database after having developed a few pages or our application? Second, loading and storing objects in a relational database exposes us to the following five mismatch problems – 1 Granularity: Sometimes you will have an object model, which has more classes than the number of corresponding tables in the database. 2 Inheritance: RDBMSs do not define anything similar to Inheritance, which is a natural paradigm in objectoriented programming languages. 3 Identity: An RDBMS defines exactly one notion of 'sameness': the primary key. Java, however, defines both object identity (a==b) and object equality (a.equals(b)). 4 Associations: Object-oriented languages represent associations using object references whereas an RDBMS represents an association as a foreign key column. 5 Navigation: The ways you access objects in Java and in RDBMS are fundamentally different. The Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is the solution to handle all the above impedance mismatches ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a programming technique for converting data between relational databases and object oriented programming languages such as Java, C#, etc. An ORM system has the following advantages over plain JDBC –  Let’s business code access objects rather than DB tables. MUQuestionPapers.com 21       Hides details of SQL queries from OO logic. Based on JDBC 'under the hood.' No need to deal with the database implementation. Entities based on business concepts rather than database structure. Transaction management and automatic key generation. Fast development of application. c) What is the relationship between JPA, ORM, Database and application? (5) JPA, ORM, Database and the Application • JPA is made up of a few classes and interfaces. • The application communicates with the configured JPA provider to access the underlying data. • Applications invoke the appropriate methods of the JPA. • The information about the mapping between the instance variables of classes and the columns of tables in the database is available either in XML and/or POJOs with the help of annotations. ORM: Object Relational Mapping is concept/process of converting the data from Object oriented language to relational DB and vice versa. For example in java its done with the help of reflection and jdbc. Application: Its the implementation of above concept. Database: Database can have number of tables. Each table can have number of attributes. Amongst the number of table some relations can be established with foreign key and primary key. One row is allotted for one record related to one object. JPA:  Its the one step above ORM. Its high level API and specification so that different ORM tools can implement so that it provides the flexibility to developer to change the implementation from one ORM to another (for example if application uses the JPA api and implementaion is hibernate.  In future it can switch to IBatis if required. But on the other if application directly lock the implementation with Hibernate without JPA platform, switching is going to be herculean task) MUQuestionPapers.com 22 d)</p>

Application clients and their container run on the client. It includes a set of Java classes and libraries, security management, naming services to Java SE applications etc. Applet container: Applet container is provided by the majority of the web browsers for the execution of Applet. The container prevents any code downloaded to the local computer from accessing local system resources such as processes or files. c) What are the alternatives to CGI? Explain in detail. (5) CGI programs provided a relatively simple way to create Web applications that accepts user input, queries a database and returns relevant results back to the Web browser. But there are certain disadvantages of using CGI like Lack of scalability and reduced speed Platform dependent, A process consumes a lot of server side resources in multi-user situation, Difficult for beginners to program modules in this environment, Less efficient etc. The alternatives to CGI is Servlets. Servlets  Are loaded into memory once and run from memory thereafter  Are created as a thread, not as a process  Are powerful object-oriented abstraction of HTTP  Are portable across multiple platforms  Are simple to design and implement  Accept client’s requests and efficiently run the requests within the secure and reliable scope of a Java Virtual Machine  Are robust and scalable CGI Replacement  Provide direct Database access using different Database drivers.  Are supported by several Web Servers. d) Write a short note on Part and WebConnection interfaces. (5) Part interface: It represents a part or form item that was received within a multipart/formdata POST request. Its frequently used methods are: InputStream getInputStream()throws IOException Gets the content of this part as an InputStream String getSubmittedFileName() Gets the file name specified by the client WebConnection interface: This interface encapsulates the connection for an upgrade request. It allows the protocol handler to send service requests and status queries to the container. It has following two methods: MUQuestionPapers.com 2 ServletInputStream getInputStream() throws IOException Returns an input stream for this web connection for reading binary data. ServletOutputStream getOutputStream()throws IOException Returns an output stream for this web connection for writing binary data. e) Explain Deployment descriptor file with its elements. (5) The web.xml file is a standard Java EE deployment descriptor, specified in the Java Servlet specification It can be changed without making any change in the source code It is used to run the application The elements of web.xml deployment descriptor file are: I. <web-app> II. <servlet> III. <session-mapping> IV. <session-config> V. <welcome-file-list> 1. <web-app> All entries are wrapped within a pair of opening and closing <web-app> elements 2. <servlet> Used to register and configure Servlet details within the opening and closing of <servlet> elements <servlet-name> - defines the name of a servlet <servlet-class> - actual servlet class name 3. <session-mapping> It is used to define mapping between servlet and the corresponding url pattern <servlet-name> - name of the servlet <url-pattern> - corresponding url details 4. <session-config> Used to specify session information <session-timeout> - used to define session timeout in minutes 5. <welcome-file-list> It consists of a set of filenames when user accesses the path of a WAR subdirectory. It consists of: <welcome-file> - it consists of either index.html or index.jsp MUQuestionPapers.com 3 f) Explain RowSet and its type in JDBC. (5) A JDBC RowSet object holds tabular data in a way that makes it more flexible and easier to use than a result set. Oracle has defined five RowSet interfaces for some of the more popular uses of a RowSet, and standard reference are available for these RowSet interfaces. These versions of the RowSet interface and their implementations have been provided as a convenience for programmers. Programmers are free to write their own versions of the javax.sql.RowSet interface, to extend the implementations of the five RowSet interfaces, or to write their own implementations. The following interfaces extend RowSet interface: • JdbcRowSet: It is a connected rowset that makes a JDBC driver look like a JavaBeans component. • CachedRowSet: it is a container for rows of data that caches its rows in memory, which makes it possible to operate without always being connected to its data source. • WebRowSet: It is a disconnected rowset that caches its data in memory in the same manner as a CachedRowSet object. As a consequence, a WebRowSet object fills a real need by making it easy for web services to send and receive data from a database in the form of an XML document. • JoinRowSet: It provides a mechanism for combining related data from different RowSet objects into one JoinRowSet object, which represents an SQL JOIN . In other words, a JoinRowSet object acts as a container for the data from RowSet objects that form an SQL JOIN relationship. • FilteredRowSet: It provides the reference implementation which may be extended if required. Alternatively, a vendor is free to implement its own version by implementing this interface. Q2 Attempt any three of the following: (15) a) Explain methods of RequstDispatcher interface. (5) RequestDispatcher interface : • • • • • • • It is used for dispatching a request. It encapsulates a reference to a web resource located at the path specified within the scope of the same servlet context. It defines an object, which receives requests from a visitor’s browser and sends the requests to any other resource on the web server. The servlet engine creates the RequestDispatcher object, which is used as a wrapper around a web server resource located through the path specified or given by a particular name. We can get the object of RequestDispatcher interface by using the method: getRequestDispatcher(), there are two ways of using this method: javax.servlet.ServletContext.getRequestDispatcher() javax.servlet.ServletRequest.getRequestDispatcher() MUQuestionPapers.com 4 Methods of RequestDispatcher : • • This interface has two methods: include() : it allows including the content produced by another resource such as servlet, JSP or HTML file in the calling servlet’s response. • forward() : it allows forwarding the request to another servlet, a JSP or HTML page on the server. This resource then take over the responsibility for producing the response. It is useful when one servlet does some preliminary processing of a request and wants to let another object complete the generation of the response. • b) Explain setting, sending and reading of Cookie in Java servlet. (5) Cookie can be created using the following contructor: Cookie(String name, String value): Constructs a cookie with the specified name and value. A cookie is just a name-value attribute that is issued by the server and stored on a client machine. It is returned by the client whenever it is accessing a certain group of URLs on a specified server. Following methods are some methods belongs to Cookie class. MUQuestionPapers.com 5 Cookies are created, stored and fetched using following methods:  Cookie.setMaxAge(int expiry): sets the maximum age in seconds for this Cookie.  HttpServletResponse.addCookie(): Adds the specified cookie to the response. This method can be called multiple times to set more than one cookie.  HttpServletRequest.getCookies(): Returns an array containing all of the Cookie objects the client sent with this request c) What is session tracking? What are the ways to track the sessions? (5) HTTP is a stateless protocol that provides no way for a server to recognize that a sequence of request come from the same client. (not even IP Address). Following are various techniques for session tracking: 1) HTTPSession 2) Cookies 3) URL rewriting 4) Hidden form fields 1) HttpSession Interface : HttpSession Interface provides a way across more than one-page request or visit to a website and to store information about that user. With the help of the HttpSession interface, a session can be created between an HTTP client and an HTTP server. This session can persist for a specified time period, across more than one connection or page request from the user. A Servlet obtains an HttpSession object using HttpSession getSession(boolean) of HttpservetRequest. 2) Providing Continuity with Cookies : cookie is just a name-value attribute that is issued by the server and stored on a client machine. It is returned by the client whenever it is accessing a certain group of URLs on a specified server. Following methods are some methods belongs to Cookie class. A cookie is a small piece of data stored on the client-side which servers use when communicating with clients. Cookies are used to identify a client when sending a subsequent request. They can also be used for passing some data from one servlet to another. 3) Hidden Form Fields : A web server can send a hidden HTML form field along with a unique session ID as follows: <input type=”hidden” name=”city” value=”Mumbai”> This could be an effective way of keeping track of the session but clicking on a regular (<A HREF…>) hypertext link does not result in a form submission. MUQuestionPapers.com 6 4) URL Rewriting : There is an alternative way to send a cookie: URL Rewriting. The cookie data is appended to the URL. You should use URL rewriting only as a fallback for browsers that do not support cookies. d) Write a short note on creation and validation of sessions. (5) The following program explains how the session is created. It also explains that till whether the session is created for the first time or not. Also if it is used 10 times then it deletes the session object using its invalidate() method. import java.io.*; import javax.servlet.*; import javax.servlet.http.*; public class CalculationVisitServlet extends HttpServlet { // private static int counter; private int counter; public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException { response.setContentType("text/html"); PrintWriter out = response.getWriter(); HttpSession session=request.getSession(true); if(session.isNew()) { out.print("This is the first time you are visiting this page"); ++counter; } else { synchronized(this) { if(counter==10) { session.invalidate(); counter=0; request.getSession(false); } else out.print("You have visited this page "+(++counter)+ " times"); } } } } MUQuestionPapers.com 7 e) Which points are important while uploading a file? (5) Following points should be considered while uploading a file: Set encodiging type attribute as follows: enctype attribute of <form> tag multipart/form-data - No characters are encoded. text/plain- Spaces are converted to "+" symbols, but no special characters are encoded type attribute value in <input>tag type="file" let the user choose one or more files from their device storage. Once chosen, the files can be uploaded to a server using form submission Part getPart() Retrieve the name, store location, size, and content-type of the file File name=--------, StoreLocation=--------, size=--------bytes, isFormField=false, FieldName=filedetails File getSubmittedFileName() It returns the selected file name from the FileOpenWindow. @MultipartConfig We need to annotate File Upload handler servlet with MultipartConfig annotation to handle multipart/form-data requests that is used for uploading file to server. MultipartConfig annotation has following attributes: • fileSizeThreshold: We can specify the size threshold after which the file will be written to disk. The size value is in bytes, so 1024*1024*10 is 10 MB. • location: Directory where files will be stored by default, it’s default value is ―‖. • maxFileSize: Maximum size allowed to upload a file, it’s value is provided in bytes. It’s default value is -1L means unlimited. • maxRequestSize: Maximum size allowed for multipart/form-data request. Default value is 1L that means unlimited. Steps to write a program to upload a file • Allow browsing the file to upload it • Allows specifying the location where to upload it • Display the message indicating a successful file upload • Display the link to return back to upload more files MUQuestionPapers.com 8 f) Explain the working of Non-Blocking I/O. (5) Non-blocking I/O:      It is Buffer-oriented Channels are available for Non-blocking I/O operation Selectors are available for Non-blocking I/O operation Non blocking IO does not wait for the data to be read or write before returning. Java NIO non- blocking mode allows the thread to request writing data to a channel, but not wait for it to be fully written. The thread is allowed to go on and do something else in a mean time.  java NIO is buffer oriented I/O approach. Data is read into a buffer from which it is further processed using a channel. In NIO we deal with the channel and buffer for I/O operation.  The major difference between a channel and a stream is:  A stream can be used for one-way data transfer.  A channel provides a two-way data transfer facility. Therefore with the introduction of channel in java NIO, the non-blocking I/O operation can be performed. Let's see the interaction between channel, buffers, java program, data source and data sink: Channels: In Java NIO, the channel is a medium that transports the data efficiently between the entity and byte buffers. It reads the data from an entity and places it inside buffer blocks for consumption. Channels act as gateway provided by java NIO to access the I/O mechanism. Usually channels have one-to-one relationship with operating system file descriptor for providing the platform independence operational feature. MUQuestionPapers.com 9 Q3 Attempt any three of the following: (15) a) How JSP functions and executes? (5) The following steps explain how the web server creates the Webpage using JSP – 1. As with a normal page, your browser sends an HTTP request to the web server. 2. The web server recognizes that the HTTP request is for a JSP page and forwards it to a JSP engine. This is done by using the URL or JSP page which ends with .jsp instead of .html. 3. The JSP engine loads the JSP page from disk and converts it into a servlet content. This conversion is very simple in which all template text is converted to println( ) statements and all JSP elements are converted to Java code. This code implements the corresponding dynamic behavior of the page. 4. The JSP engine compiles the servlet into an executable class and forwards the original request to a servlet engine. 5. A part of the web server called the servlet engine loads the Servlet class and executes it. During execution, the servlet produces an output in HTML format. The output is further passed on to the web server by the servlet engine inside an HTTP response. 6. The web server forwards the HTTP response to your browser in terms of static HTML content. Finally, the web browser handles the dynamically-generated HTML page inside the HTTP response exactly as if it were a static page. MUQuestionPapers.com 10 b) How to set and access the properties of Java bean in JSP? (5) The <jsp: useBean> element is used to access the bean in jsp. This element instantiates an object of the bean class specified by class name & binds it to an object with the name specified. A new object is instantiated only if only if there is no existing one with the same ID & scope. The useBean action creates a Java object in a specified scope. The object is also made available in the current JSP page as a scripting variable. The syntax for the useBean action is: <jsp:useBean id= "beanobjname" class="className " | beanName=―className " scope="page | request | session | application‖ > </jsp:useBean> The setProperty action can be used in conjunction with the useBean action to set the properties of a bean. We can even get the container to populate the bean properties from the request parameters without specifying the property names. In such cases the container will match the bean property names with the request parameter names. The syntax for the setProperty action is shown below: <jsp:setProperty name=―BeanObj" property="*" | property="propertyName" | [param="paramName" value="value―] /> The getProperty action can be used in conjunction with the useBean action to get the value of the properties of the bean defined by the useBean action. For example: <jsp:getProperty name=―BeanObj" property="firstName"/> c) What are the types of expressions in EL? (5) The Expression Language (EL) simplifies the accessibility of data stored in the Java Bean component, and other objects like request, session, application etc. There are many implicit objects, operators and reserve words in EL. It can be used for the following cases: To fetch the parameter from another jsp file as: ${ param.name } To perform arithmetic operators: e.g. 5*5+4: ${5*5+4} To perform logical operator as: true and true: ${true and true} To perform relational operator as: 3.2>=2: ${3.2>=2} To perform conditional operator as: The result of 10>2 is: "${(10>1)?'greater':'lesser'}" To perform empty operator as: The Value for the Empty operator is:: ${empty ""}<br> MUQuestionPapers.com 11 Types of Expressions • The unified EL provides 2 types of expressions: – Value Expression – Method Expression  Value Expression: It is further categorized as: • Rvalue expressions: can only read data, but cannot write data. Expressions that use immediate evaluation syntax are always rvalue expressions. • Lvalue expressions: can read and write data. Expressions that use deferred evaluation syntax can act as both rvalue and lvalue expressions.  Method Expressions: • A JSF component uses method expressions, Which in turn invokes methods that do some processing on behalf of the component element. • For std. components, these methods are necessary for handling events that the components generates as well as validating component data.  Using EL Expressions: It can be used in 2 situations: As attribute values in std. and custom actions. In template text such as HTML or non-JSP elements, in the JSP file. d) Write a short note on restriction, projection and partitioning operators in EL. (5) Restriction operator – where: Iterates over the source sequence and yields those elements for which the predicate function returns true. The predicate function accepts two arguments: The first one represents the element to test The second, if present, represents the zero-based index of the element within the source sequence. e.g. employees.where(e->e.salary >=10000) projection operator - select: Iterates over the source sequence and yields the results of evaluating the selector Lambda for each element. The selector accepts two arguments: The first one represents the element to process The second, if present, represents the zero-based index of the element within the source sequence. E.g. employees.select(e->e.EmployeeName) partitioning operator - take: Iterates over the source sequence and yields a given number of elements from a sequence and then skips the remainder of the sequence. e.g. employees.take(100) MUQuestionPapers.com 12 partitioning operator - skip: Iterates over the source sequence and skips a given number of elements from a sequence and then yields the remainder of the sequence. e.g. employees.skip(2) e) Explain conditional or flow control statements in XML Tag Library with example. (5) The <x:if> tag is used for evaluating the test XPath expression. It is a simple conditional tag which is used for evaluating its body if the supplied condition is true. The syntax used for including the <x:if> tag is: <x:if attributes> body content </x:if> <%@ taglib prefix="c" uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core" %> <%@ taglib prefix="x" uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/xml" %> <html> <head> <title>x:if Tags</title> </head> <body> <h2>Vegetable Information:</h2> <c:set var="vegetables"> <vegetables> <vegetable> <name>onion</name> <price>40</price> </vegetable> <vegetable> <name>Potato</name> <price>30</price> </vegetable> </vegetables> </c:set> <x:parse xml="${vegetables}" var="output"/> <x:if select="$output/vegetables/vegetable/price < 100"> Vegetables prices are very low. </x:if> </body> </html> MUQuestionPapers.com 13 f) How to query and update data in JSTL? (5) The <sql:query> tag is used for executing the SQL query defined in its sql attribute or the body. It is used to execute an SQL SELECT statement and saves the result in scoped variable. Example: <sql:query dataSource="${db}" var="rs"> SELECT * from Students; </sql:query> The <sql:update> tag is used for executing the SQL DML query defined in its sql attribute or in the tag body. It may be SQL UPDATE, INSERT or DELETE statements. Example: <sql:update dataSource="${db}" var="count"> INSERT INTO Students VALUES (154,'Nasreen', 'jaha', 25); </sql:update> Q4 Attempt any three of the following: (15) a) Write a short note on enterprise bean server and enterprise bean. (5) enterprise bean server: • It is a component transaction server. • It supports the EJB server side component model fro developing and deploying distributed enterprise level applications in a multi-tiered environment. • It provides: • • • The framework for creating, deploying and managing middle-tier business logic. • An environment that allows the execution of applications developed using EJB components. In a three-tier environment: • The client provides the user interface logic • The business rules are separated to the middle tier • The database is the information repository An EJB server takes care of: • Managing and coordinating the allocation of resources to the applications MUQuestionPapers.com 14 • Security • Threads, Connection pooling enterprise bean: • It is a server-side component that encapsulates the code that fulfills the purpose of the application. • They can be combined with other components and rapidly produce a custom application. • The main purpose of introducing EJB was for building distributed components. • It was designed to solve all the issues n complexities of CORBA. • This technology is powerful n easy. It helps developers to build business applications that support very large no. of user simultaneously. • The EJB components can be assembled and reassembled into different distributed applications as per the requirements. b) Describe packaging of enterprise beans in JAR and WAR modules. (5) An EJB JAR file is portable and can be used for various applications. EJB 3.0 required packaging:      Web application in a WAR file – Web application archive EJB’s package in a JAR file – java archive WAR and JAR files into an EAR file – Enterprise application archive To assemble a Java EE application, package one or more modules into an EAR file, the archive file that holds the application. When deploying the EAR file that contains the enterprise bean's EJB JAR file, you also deploy the enterprise bean to GlassFish Server. You can also deploy an EJB JAR that is not contained in an EAR file. Figure shows the contents of an EJB JAR file. MUQuestionPapers.com 15 Packaging Enterprise Beans in WAR Modules        Enterprise beans often provide the business logic of a web application. In these cases, packaging the enterprise bean within the web application's WAR module simplifies deployment and application organization. To include enterprise bean class files in a WAR module, the class files should be in the WEB-INF/classes directory. To include a JAR file that contains enterprise beans in a WAR module, add the JAR to the WEB-INF/lib directory of the WAR module. WAR modules that contain enterprise beans do not require an ejb-jar.xml deployment descriptor. If the application uses ejb-jar.xml, it must be located in the WAR module's WEB-INF directory. For example, suppose that a web application consists of a shopping cart enterprise bean, a credit card–processing enterprise bean, and a Java servlet front end. The shopping cart bean exposes a local, no-interface view and is defined as follows: package com.example.cart; @Stateless public class CartBean { ... } The credit card–processing bean is packaged within its own JAR file, cc.jar, exposes a local, no-interface view, and is defined as follows: package com.example.cc; @Stateless public class CreditCardBean { ... } The servlet, com.example.web.StoreServlet, handles the web front end and uses both CartBean and CreditCardBean. The WAR module layout for this application is as follows: WEB-INF/classes/com/example/cart/CartBean.class WEB-INF/classes/com/example/web/StoreServlet WEB-INF/lib/cc.jar WEB-INF/ejb-jar.xml WEB-INF/web.xml c) How to access no-interface view and local business interface ? (5) • Accessing No-Interface View/Local Business/ Remote Business Interface: • Client access to an enterprise bean that exposes a local, no-interface view is accomplished either through dependency injection or JNDI lookup. • Client access using dependency injection: • • To obtain a reference to the no-interface view of an enterprise bean through dependency injection, use the javax.ejb.EJB annotation and specify the enterprise bean’s implementation class: @EJB Client access using JNDI lookup: MUQuestionPapers.com 16 • To obtain a reference to the no-interface view of an enterprise bean through JNDI lookup, use the javax.naming.InitialContext interface’s lookup method: IntialContext.lookup (); Method of accessing the enterprise Bean Remote Clients A remote client of an enterprise bean has the following traits (characteristics):      It can run on a different machine and a different Java virtual machine than the enterprise bean it accesses. It can be a web component, an application client, or another enterprise bean. To a remote client, the location of the enterprise bean is transparent. To create an enterprise bean that has remote access, you must code a remote interface and a home interface. The remote interface defines the business methods that are specific to the bean. The home interface defines the bean's life-cycle methods Local Clients A local client has these characteristics:      It must run in the same JVM as the enterprise bean it accesses. It can be a web component or another enterprise bean. To the local client, the location of the enterprise bean it accesses is not transparent. To build an enterprise bean that allows local access, you must code the local interface and the local home interface. The local interface defines the bean's business methods, and the local home interface defines its life-cycle. d) Write a short note on lifecycle of a Message Driven Bean with onMessage() method. (5) Lifecycle of Message Driven Bean: • The EJB container usually creates a pool of MDB instances. • For each instance, the EJB container performs these tasks: • If the MDB uses dependency injection, the container injects these references before instantiating the instance. • The container calls the method annotated @PostConstruct(if any). • Like a stateless session bean, a MDB is never passivated and it has only two states: • Nonexistent MUQuestionPapers.com 17 • Ready to receive messages Contain business logic for handling received messages to perform the operations such as • Computation/calculation • Initiating a step in a workflow • Storing data • Sending another message • Transfer data with another EJB for further processing • Are messages listeners, consuming messages from JMS destination such as queue or a topic • May invoke other EJB components to get some help onMessage() Method • In MDB, metadata annotations are used to specify the bean type. • In this case, @MessageDriven specifies the destination monitored by thie MDB. • The bean class need not implement the javax.ejb.MessageDrivenBean interface. • The onMessage() method is activated on the reception of messages sent by a client application to the corresponding JMS destination. MUQuestionPapers.com 18 e) How to define interceptor? What is the role of ArroundInvoke method? (5) Defining an Interceptor • Interceptor methods can be used to intercept either a business method or lifecycle event. • An interceptor that intercepts a business method is typically called an AroundInvoke method because it can be defined by annotating the method with an @AroundInvoke annotation. • An AroundInvoke method can be defined on: • • Enterprise bean class • Interceptor class An interceptor class is a normal java class. It does not need to extend any special class or implement any interface. AroundInvoke Method • It can be defined by either of the following methods: • Annotating the method with an @AroundInvoke annotation. • Using an element in the bean’s deployment descriptor. It must satisfy the following requirements: • One AroundInvoke method is allowed for each class. • It must have a no argument public constructor. • It must accept an javax.interceptor.InvocationCOntext object as an argument and return a java.lang.Object object. • It can throw any application exception that is specified in the business interface or any runtime exception. • It can be declared private, package private, protected or public. It must call InvocationContext.proceed() to signal its intention to continue the invocation. • Applying Interceptor • Adding an interceptor to an enterprise bean • Build and run the web application MUQuestionPapers.com 19 f) What is dataSource Resource Definition in Java EE? (5) • Java EE applications use datasource objects when they access relational databases through the JDBC API. • A datasource has a set of properties that identify the data source that it represents. • These properties include information such as : • The location of the database server • The name of the database • The network protocol to use to communicate with the server. • A datasource object also works with a JNDI naming service. • After registration the application can use the JNDI API to access that datasource object, which then can be used to connect to the datasource it represents. The name element uniquely identifies a DataSource and is registered with JNDI. The value specified in the name element begins with a namespace scope. Java EE includes the following scopes:       java:comp—Names in this namespace have per-component visibility. java:module—Names in this namespace are shared by all components in a module, for example, the EJB components defined in an a ejb-jar.xml file. java:app—Names in this namespace are shared by all components and modules in an application, for example, the application-client, web, and EJB components in an .ear file. java:global—Names in this namespace are shared by all the applications in the server. You can programmatically declare DataSource definitions using one of the following methods: Creating DataSource Resource Definitions Using Annotations Creating DataSource Resource Definition Using Deployment Descriptors Q5 Attempt any three of the following: (15) a) Explain Java Persistence API with specification. (5) Java Persistence API with specification: 1. Java Persistence API is a specification, which is released under Java EE 5 specification. 2. It is neither an implementation nor a product. Hence, it cannot be used as it is for persistence. It needs an ORM implementation to work with and persist Java Objects. 3. Technically, JPA is just a set of interfaces [a Specification] and thus requires an implementation. MUQuestionPapers.com 20 4. All specifications require vendors or open source projects to implement them. Using JPA therefore requires picking up an implementation [ORM tool such as Hibernate, Toplink, OpenJPA or any other ORM that implements JPA]. 5. JPA defines the interface that an implementation has to implement. 6. The whole point of having a standard interface is that users can, in principle, switch between implementations of JPA without changing their code. 7. This way, JPA helps prevent Vendor Lock-In by relying on a strict specification such as JDO and EJB 2.x entities. 8. Currently most of the persistence vendors[ORM tool providers] have released implementations of JPA. 9. Since, the Java Persistence code spec covers several persistence frameworks into a single API, an application written using JPA will work across several implementations [Hibernate, Toplink and so on]. This is very useful, especially when, development begins using the free open source ORM implementations and later on when the need arises, the open source implementation is swapped with a commercial ORM implementation. The switch happens without changing the application code spec. b) What is Impedance Mismatch? How it can be solved? (5) First problem, what if we need to modify the design of our database after having developed a few pages or our application? Second, loading and storing objects in a relational database exposes us to the following five mismatch problems – 1 Granularity: Sometimes you will have an object model, which has more classes than the number of corresponding tables in the database. 2 Inheritance: RDBMSs do not define anything similar to Inheritance, which is a natural paradigm in objectoriented programming languages. 3 Identity: An RDBMS defines exactly one notion of 'sameness': the primary key. Java, however, defines both object identity (a==b) and object equality (a.equals(b)). 4 Associations: Object-oriented languages represent associations using object references whereas an RDBMS represents an association as a foreign key column. 5 Navigation: The ways you access objects in Java and in RDBMS are fundamentally different. The Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is the solution to handle all the above impedance mismatches ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a programming technique for converting data between relational databases and object oriented programming languages such as Java, C#, etc. An ORM system has the following advantages over plain JDBC –  Let’s business code access objects rather than DB tables. MUQuestionPapers.com 21       Hides details of SQL queries from OO logic. Based on JDBC 'under the hood.' No need to deal with the database implementation. Entities based on business concepts rather than database structure. Transaction management and automatic key generation. Fast development of application. c) What is the relationship between JPA, ORM, Database and application? (5) JPA, ORM, Database and the Application • JPA is made up of a few classes and interfaces. • The application communicates with the configured JPA provider to access the underlying data. • Applications invoke the appropriate methods of the JPA. • The information about the mapping between the instance variables of classes and the columns of tables in the database is available either in XML and/or POJOs with the help of annotations. ORM: Object Relational Mapping is concept/process of converting the data from Object oriented language to relational DB and vice versa. For example in java its done with the help of reflection and jdbc. Application: Its the implementation of above concept. Database: Database can have number of tables. Each table can have number of attributes. Amongst the number of table some relations can be established with foreign key and primary key. One row is allotted for one record related to one object. JPA:  Its the one step above ORM. Its high level API and specification so that different ORM tools can implement so that it provides the flexibility to developer to change the implementation from one ORM to another (for example if application uses the JPA api and implementaion is hibernate.  In future it can switch to IBatis if required. But on the other if application directly lock the implementation with Hibernate without JPA platform, switching is going to be herculean task) MUQuestionPapers.com 22 d)</p>

MUQuestionPapers.com 23 Components of Hibernate: • Connection Management: provides efficient management of the database connection. Database connection is the most expensive part of an application that allows interacting with the database. • Transaction Management: provides ability to execute more than one database statements at a time. • Object Relational Mapping: is a technique of mapping the data representation from an object model to a relational model.

                    <p>Explain session management rules. [5] Ans.  A session is a way to maintain state information between HTTP requests for a single user or client.  Sessions are typically used to store user-specific data, such as shopping cart items or login credentials, that needs to persist across multiple requests.  Session management involves the creation, maintenance, and destruction of sessions.  The following are some rules for session management: 1. Session ID generation: A unique session ID should be generated for each new session. This ID should be difficult to guess or predict to prevent session hijacking attacks. MUQuestionPapers.com 2. Session ID storage: The session ID should be stored in a cookie or in the URL. If stored in a cookie, the cookie should be marked as secure and HttpOnly to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. 3. Session timeout: Sessions should have a timeout period to prevent them from being active indefinitely. The timeout period should be long enough to allow users to complete their tasks, but short enough to prevent sessions from being hijacked. 4. Session data storage: Session data should be stored on the server side, not on the client side. This prevents users from tampering with the session data and allows the server to control the lifetime of the session. 5. Session termination: Sessions should be terminated when the user logs out or when the session timeout period is reached. This ensures that session data is not left active for longer than necessary.

                    <p>How it works? [5] Ans.  Non-blocking I/O is a technique that allows a program to perform I/O operations without blocking the execution of the program.  Non-blocking I/O is useful in situations where the program needs to perform I/O operations on multiple input/output streams simultaneously.  In non-blocking I/O, the program initiates an I/O operation and then continues executing other code without waiting for the I/O operation to complete. MUQuestionPapers.com  When the I/O operation is complete, the program is notified and can then process the data that was read or written.  Non-blocking I/O works by using a special system call that allows the program to check if an I/O operation can be performed without blocking.  If an I/O operation can be performed without blocking, the program can initiate the operation and continue executing other code.  If an I/O operation would block, the program can choose to wait for the operation to complete or continue executing other code.  Non-blocking I/O is often used in network programming to handle multiple connections simultaneously. By using non-blocking I/O, a program can process data from multiple network connections without blocking on any one connection.  This can improve the performance of network applications and allow them to handle more connections simultaneously.

                    <p>Describe Xpath in detail. [5] Ans.  JSTL stands for JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library, which is a collection of JSP tags that encapsulate core functionality common to many JSP applications.  JSTL provides a set of tags that can be used to perform common tasks such as looping over collections, formatting data, and conditional processing.  JSTL is designed to simplify JSP development by providing a standard set of tags that can be used across different JSP containers.  XPath is a language used for selecting nodes from an XML document. MUQuestionPapers.com  XPath is used to navigate through elements and attributes in an XML document and is used by many XML-related technologies, including XSLT, XQuery, and XML Schema. XPath uses a path-like syntax to identify nodes in an XML document.  XPath expressions are used to select nodes in an XML document.  XPath expressions can be used to select nodes based on their name, value, or position in the document.  XPath expressions are evaluated against an XML document and return a set of nodes that match the expression.  XPath expressions can use a variety of operators and functions to select nodes.

                    <h5>Answer:</h5>
                    <p>[5] Ans  A naming service provides a way to overcome these difficulties by providing a centralized directory of services that clients can use to locate the services they need.  The naming service maps the names of services to their network addresses.  Clients can use the name of a service to look up its network address in the naming service's directory.  Once the client has the network address, it can use it to connect to the service and use it.  The naming service acts as an intermediary between the client and the service, allowing the client to access the service without having to know its physical location.  Naming services provide several benefits to distributed systems. MUQuestionPapers.com  They make it easier for clients to locate and use services, even when the services are located on different machines or have different network addresses.  They also make it easier to add or remove services from the system, because clients can use the naming service to locate the services they need, rather than having to know their physical location.

                            <p>[5] Ans  A naming service provides a way to overcome these difficulties by providing a centralized directory of services that clients can use to locate the services they need.  The naming service maps the names of services to their network addresses.  Clients can use the name of a service to look up its network address in the naming service's directory.  Once the client has the network address, it can use it to connect to the service and use it.  The naming service acts as an intermediary between the client and the service, allowing the client to access the service without having to know its physical location.  Naming services provide several benefits to distributed systems. MUQuestionPapers.com  They make it easier for clients to locate and use services, even when the services are located on different machines or have different network addresses.  They also make it easier to add or remove services from the system, because clients can use the naming service to locate the services they need, rather than having to know their physical location.

                    <p>(5) − An extension of 3-tier architecture is nothing but n-tier(MultiTier) architecture. MUQuestionPapers.com − Service layer is one machine, data layer in one machine, presentation layer is in morethan one machine. i.e. windows based enterprise application can be 3-tier architecture cannot be ‘n’ tier as presentation layer runs in only one machine as one process. − Web-enabling a 3-tier architectural enterprise application is nothing but making it n-tiered. − The Java EE platform uses a distributed multitiered application model for enterprise applications. Application logic is divided into components according to function, and the application components that make up a Java EE application are installed on various machines depending on the tier in the multitiered Java EE environment to which the application component belongs. − Tiers separate functionality: o Presentation Logic, Business Logic, Data Schema. − Code that generates input screens and representing pages for the end-user is known as presentation logic. − Data processing logic according to the business rules of the organization is nothing but business logic. − Flow control logic is known as application logic. − Easier upgrade since one tier can be changed without changing the rest. − Lower deployment and maintenance cost. − More flexible. − More extensible(can add functionality). MUQuestionPapers.com c. List and explain the tasks that Servlet can do. (5) − Read the explicit data sent by the clients (browsers). This includes an HTML form on a Web page or it could also come from an applet or a custom HTTP client program. − Read the implicit HTTP request data sent by the clients (browsers). This includes cookies, media types and compression schemes the browser understands, and so forth. − Process the data and generate the results. This process may require talking to a database, executing an RMI or CORBA call, invoking a Web service, or computing the response directly. − Send the explicit data (i.e., the document) to the clients (browsers). This document can be sent in a variety of formats, including text (HTML or XML), binary (GIF images)</p>

                    <h5>Answer:</h5>
                    <p>Explain. (5) Java EE Containers: Normally, thin-client multitier applications are hard to write because they involve many lines of intricate code to handle transaction and state management, multithreading, resource pooling, and other complex low-level details. The component-based and platform-independent Java EE architecture makes Java EE applications easy to write because business logic is organized into reusable components. In addition, the Java EE server provides underlying services in the form of a container for every component type. Because you do not have to develop these services yourself, you are free to concentrate on solving the business problem at hand. Container Services: Containers are the interface between a component and the low-level platform specific functionality that supports the component. Before a web, enterprise bean, or application client component can be executed, it must be assembled into a Java EE module and deployed into its container. The Java EE security model lets you configure a web component or enterprise bean so that system resources are accessed only by authorized users.  The Java EE transaction model lets you specify relationships among methods that make up a single transaction so that all methods in one transaction are treated as a single unit.  JNDI lookup services provide a unified interface to multiple naming and directory services in the enterprise so that application components can access these services.  The Java EE remote connectivity model manages low-level communications between clients and enterprise beans. After an enterprise bean is created, a client invokes methods on it as if it were in the same virtual machine. Container Types:  Java EE server: The runtime portion of a Java EE product. A Java EE server provides EJB and web containers. MUQuestionPapers.com 2  Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) container: Manages the execution of enterprise beans for Java EE applications. Enterprise beans and their container run on the Java EE server.  Web container: Manages the execution of JSP page and servlet components for Java EE applications. Web components and their container run on the Java EE server.  Application client container: Manages the execution of application client components. Application clients and their container run on the client.  Applet container: Manages the execution of applets. Consists of a web browser and Java Plug-in running on the client together. The deployment process installs Java EE application components in the Java EE containers as illustrated in following Figure: c)</p>

                            <p>Explain. (5) Java EE Containers: Normally, thin-client multitier applications are hard to write because they involve many lines of intricate code to handle transaction and state management, multithreading, resource pooling, and other complex low-level details. The component-based and platform-independent Java EE architecture makes Java EE applications easy to write because business logic is organized into reusable components. In addition, the Java EE server provides underlying services in the form of a container for every component type. Because you do not have to develop these services yourself, you are free to concentrate on solving the business problem at hand. Container Services: Containers are the interface between a component and the low-level platform specific functionality that supports the component. Before a web, enterprise bean, or application client component can be executed, it must be assembled into a Java EE module and deployed into its container. The Java EE security model lets you configure a web component or enterprise bean so that system resources are accessed only by authorized users.  The Java EE transaction model lets you specify relationships among methods that make up a single transaction so that all methods in one transaction are treated as a single unit.  JNDI lookup services provide a unified interface to multiple naming and directory services in the enterprise so that application components can access these services.  The Java EE remote connectivity model manages low-level communications between clients and enterprise beans. After an enterprise bean is created, a client invokes methods on it as if it were in the same virtual machine. Container Types:  Java EE server: The runtime portion of a Java EE product. A Java EE server provides EJB and web containers. MUQuestionPapers.com 2  Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) container: Manages the execution of enterprise beans for Java EE applications. Enterprise beans and their container run on the Java EE server.  Web container: Manages the execution of JSP page and servlet components for Java EE applications. Web components and their container run on the Java EE server.  Application client container: Manages the execution of application client components. Application clients and their container run on the client.  Applet container: Manages the execution of applets. Consists of a web browser and Java Plug-in running on the client together. The deployment process installs Java EE application components in the Java EE containers as illustrated in following Figure: c)</p>

                            <p>(5) A Servlet can be used with an HTML form tag to allow users to upload files to the server. An uploaded file could be a text file or image file or any document. Creating a File Upload Form: The following HTM code below creates an uploader form. Following are the important points to be noted down –     The form method attribute should be set to POSTmethod and GET method can not be used The form enctype attribute should be set to multipart/form-data The form action attribute should be set to a servlet file which would handle file uploading at backend server. Following example is using UploadServlet servlet to upload file. To upload a single file you should use a single <input .../> tag with attributetype="file". To allow multiple files uploading, include more than oneinput tags with different values for the name attribute. The browserassociates a Browse button with each of them.

(5) Expression Language (EL) is mechanism that simplifies the accessibility of the data stored in Java bean component and other object like request, session and application, etc. Immediate Evaluation: All expressions using the ${} syntax are evaluated immediately. These expressions can only be used within template text or as the value of a JSP tag attribute that can accept runtime expressions. The following example shows a tag whose value attribute references an immediate evaluation expression that gets the total price from the session-scoped bean named cart: <fmt:formatNumber value="${sessionScope.cart.total}"/> The JSP engine evaluates the expression, ${sessionScope.cart.total}, converts it,and passes the returned value to the tag handler.Immediate evaluation expressions are always read-only value expressions. The expression shown above can only get the total price from the cart bean; it cannot set the total price. Deferred Evaluation: Deferred evaluation expressions take the form #{expr} and can be evaluated at other phases of a page life cycle as defined by whatever technology is using the expression. In the case of JavaServer Faces technology, its controller can evaluate the expression at different phases of the life cycle depending on how the expression is being used in the page. The following example shows a JavaServer Faces inputText tag, which represents a text field component into which a user enters a value.The inputText tag‟s value attribute references a deferred evaluation expression that points to the name property of the customerbean. <h:inputText id="name" value="#{customer.name}" /> For an initial request of the page containing this tag, the JavaServer Faces implementation evaluates the #{customer.name} expression during the render response phase of the life cycle. During this phase, the expression merely accesses the value of name from the customerbean, as is done in immediate evaluation. c)</p>

JSTL Expression language handles JavaBean code very easily. We don't need to MUQuestionPapers.com 16 downcast the objects, which has been retrieved as scoped attributes. Using JSP scriptlets code will be complicated, and JSTL has simplified that purpose. 4. Easier for humans to read: JSTL is based on XML, which is very similar to HTML. Hence, it is easy for the developers to understand. 5. Easier for computers to understand: Tools such as Dreamweaver and front page are generating more and more HTML code. HTML tools do a great job of formatting HTML code. The HTML code is mixed with the scriplet code. As JSTL is expressed as XML compliant tags, it is easy for HTML generation to parse the JSTL code within the document. d)</p>

                    <p>Also explain resource injection in JNDI. (5) Basic Lookup • JNDI organizes its names into a hierarchy. • A name can be any string such as org.ejb.ConverterBean or can also be an object that supports the Name interface. • A string is the most common way to name an object. • A name is bound to an object in the directory by storing either the object or a reference to the object in the directory service identified by the name. • The user of the JNDI client API will first be required to create an initial context to the naming or directory service to connect to. • This initial context establishes a connection with the naming or directory service when it is constructed with a set of properties that describes: • • • The specific naming or directory service provider library to use. • The URL of the naming or directory service process. • A user name and credentials JNDI API defines a context that specifies where to look for an object. The initial context is typically used as a starting point for all naming and directory operations. An initial context must be created using specific implementation and extra parameters required by the implementation. The initial context will be used to look up a name. MUQuestionPapers.com 23 • After an initial context to a naming or directory service is established, the root context or sub-context reference is used, which performs various operations on the context depending on the type of context. • Naming contexts can be used for binding and unbinding names and objects, list names and name bindings and lookup object references of named objects. Resource injection  One of the simplification features of Java EE is the implementation of basic Resource Injection to simplify web and EJB components.  Resource injection enables you to inject any resource available in the JNDI namespace into any container-managed object, such as a servlet, an enterprise bean, or a managed bean. For eg, we can use resource injection to inject data sources, connectors, or any other desired resources available in the JNDI namespace.  The type we‟ll use for the reference to the instance happen to be injected is usually an interface, which would decouple our code from the implementation of the resource. For better understanding of the above statement let‟s take a look at the example.  The resource injection can be performed in the following three ways:  Field Injection  Method Injection  Class injection f)</p>

                    <p>(5) Persistence: • The javax.persistence.Persistence class contains static helper methods to obtain EntityManagerFactory instances in a vendor-neutral fashion. EntityManagerFactory: • It is created with the help of a persistence unit during the application start up. It serves as a factory for spawning EntityManager objects when required. Typically it is created once and kept alive for later use. EntityManager: • The EntityManager object is lightweight and inexpensive to create. It provides the main interface to perform actual database operations. • All the persistence objects are saved and retrieved with the help of an EntityManager object. These are created as needed and destroyed when not required. Entity: • Entities are persistence objects that represent datastore records. EntityTransaction: • A transaction represents a unit of work with the database. Any kind of modification initiated via EntityManager object are placed within a transaction. An EntityManager object helps creating an EntityTransaction object. These objects are typically used for a short time and are closed by either committing or rejecting. Query: • Persistence objects are retrieved using a query object. It allows using SQL or JPQL queries to retrieve the actual data from the database and create objects. Criteria: • Criteria API is a non-string-based API for the dynamic construction of object-based queries. • Criteria query objects are passed to the EntityManager‟s createQuery() method to create query objects and then executed using the methods of Query API. The above classes and interfaces are used for storing entities into a database as a record. They help programmers by reducing their efforts to write codes for storing data into a database so that they can concentrate on more important activities such as writing codes for mapping the classes with database tables.

                    <p>(5)  Hibernate is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) solution for JAVA. It is an open source persistent framework created by Gavin King in 2001. It is a powerful, high performance Object-Relational Persistence and Query service for any Java Application.  Hibernate maps Java classes to database tables and from Java data types to SQL data types and relieves the developer from 95% of common data persistence related programming tasks.  Hibernate sits between traditional Java objects and database server to handle all the works in persisting those objects based on the appropriate O/R mechanisms and patterns.
