                        (5) Non-blocking I/O:      It is Buffer-oriented Channels are available for Non-blocking I/O operation Selectors are available for Non-blocking I/O operation Non blocking IO does not wait for the data to be read or write before returning. Java NIO non- blocking mode allows the thread to request writing data to a channel, but not wait for it to be fully written. The thread is allowed to go on and do something else in a mean time.  java NIO is buffer oriented I/O approach. Data is read into a buffer from which it is further processed using a channel. In NIO we deal with the channel and buffer for I/O operation.  The major difference between a channel and a stream is:  A stream can be used for one-way data transfer.  A channel provides a two-way data transfer facility. Therefore with the introduction of channel in java NIO, the non-blocking I/O operation can be performed. Let's see the interaction between channel, buffers, java program, data source and data sink: Channels: In Java NIO, the channel is a medium that transports the data efficiently between the entity and byte buffers. It reads the data from an entity and places it inside buffer blocks for consumption. Channels act as gateway provided by java NIO to access the I/O mechanism. Usually channels have one-to-one relationship with operating system file descriptor for providing the platform independence operational feature. Q3 Attempt any three of the following: (15)

                        Explain its types? [5] Ans.  Directives in JSP are special instructions that are used to provide information to the JSP container about how to translate a JSP file into a servlet. There are three types of directives in JSP: 1. Page directive: The page directive is used to provide information about the JSP page to the JSP container. It is placed at the top of the JSP file and begins with the <%@ symbol. The page directive can be used to specify attributes such as the content type, language, error page, and session behavior. 2. Include directive: The include directive is used to include the contents of another file in the JSP page. It is placed in the body of the JSP file and begins with the <%@ symbol. The include directive can be used to include static files such as HTML or text files. 3. Taglib directive: MUQuestionPapers.com The taglib directive is used to define a custom tag library that can be used in the JSP page. It is placed at the top of the JSP file and begins with the <%@ symbol. The taglib directive specifies the URI of the tag library and the location of the tag library descriptor file.  Overall, directives in JSP are used to provide important information to the JSP container and to include external files or custom tag libraries in the JSP page.

                        (5) The Java EE server provides services to Java EE components in the form of a container.  The EJB Container: Java EE server components that are coded to hold business logic are called Enterprise JavaBeans[EJB]. The Java EE server’s EJB container provides local and remote access to EJB. The EJB container: • Creates new instance of EJBs • Manages their life cycle • Provides services such as: • Transaction • Security • Concurrency • Distribution • Naming service • The possibility to be involved asynchronously  The Web Container: A Java EE container that hosts web applications is a web container. It is responsible for instantiating and invoking servlets and supporting the HTTP and HTTPS protocols. It is the container used to feed web pages to client browsers.   The Application Client Container: It provides services required for the execution of application client components. Application clients and their container run on the client. It includes a set of Java classes and libraries, security management, naming services to Java SE applications etc. Applet container: Applet container is provided by the majority of the web browsers for the execution of Applet. The container prevents any code downloaded to the local computer from accessing local system resources such as processes or files.

                                (5) The Java EE server provides services to Java EE components in the form of a container.  The EJB Container: Java EE server components that are coded to hold business logic are called Enterprise JavaBeans[EJB]. The Java EE server’s EJB container provides local and remote access to EJB. The EJB container: • Creates new instance of EJBs • Manages their life cycle • Provides services such as: • Transaction • Security • Concurrency • Distribution • Naming service • The possibility to be involved asynchronously  The Web Container: A Java EE container that hosts web applications is a web container. It is responsible for instantiating and invoking servlets and supporting the HTTP and HTTPS protocols. It is the container used to feed web pages to client browsers.   The Application Client Container: It provides services required for the execution of application client components. Application clients and their container run on the client. It includes a set of Java classes and libraries, security management, naming services to Java SE applications etc. Applet container: Applet container is provided by the majority of the web browsers for the execution of Applet. The container prevents any code downloaded to the local computer from accessing local system resources such as processes or files.

                        (5) RequestDispatcher interface : • • • • • • • It is used for dispatching a request. It encapsulates a reference to a web resource located at the path specified within the scope of the same servlet context. It defines an object, which receives requests from a visitor’s browser and sends the requests to any other resource on the web server. The servlet engine creates the RequestDispatcher object, which is used as a wrapper around a web server resource located through the path specified or given by a particular name. We can get the object of RequestDispatcher interface by using the method: getRequestDispatcher(), there are two ways of using this method: javax.servlet.ServletContext.getRequestDispatcher() javax.servlet.ServletRequest.getRequestDispatcher() Methods of RequestDispatcher : • • This interface has two methods: include() : it allows including the content produced by another resource such as servlet, JSP or HTML file in the calling servlet’s response. • forward() : it allows forwarding the request to another servlet, a JSP or HTML page on the server. This resource then take over the responsibility for producing the response. It is useful when one servlet does some preliminary processing of a request and wants to let another object complete the generation of the response. •

A cookie is a small piece of data stored on the client-side which servers use when communicating with clients. Cookies are used to identify a client when sending a subsequent request. They can also be used for passing some data from one servlet to another. 3) Hidden Form Fields : A web server can send a hidden HTML form field along with a unique session ID as follows: <input type=”hidden” name=”city” value=”Mumbai”> This could be an effective way of keeping track of the session but clicking on a regular (<A HREF…>) hypertext link does not result in a form submission. 4) URL Rewriting : There is an alternative way to send a cookie: URL Rewriting. The cookie data is appended to the URL. You should use URL rewriting only as a fallback for browsers that do not support cookies.

                        (5) The following steps explain how the web server creates the Webpage using JSP – 1. As with a normal page, your browser sends an HTTP request to the web server. 2. The web server recognizes that the HTTP request is for a JSP page and forwards it to a JSP engine. This is done by using the URL or JSP page which ends with .jsp instead of .html. 3. The JSP engine loads the JSP page from disk and converts it into a servlet content. This conversion is very simple in which all template text is converted to println( ) statements and all JSP elements are converted to Java code. This code implements the corresponding dynamic behavior of the page. 4. The JSP engine compiles the servlet into an executable class and forwards the original request to a servlet engine. 5. A part of the web server called the servlet engine loads the Servlet class and executes it. During execution, the servlet produces an output in HTML format. The output is further passed on to the web server by the servlet engine inside an HTTP response. 6. The web server forwards the HTTP response to your browser in terms of static HTML content. Finally, the web browser handles the dynamically-generated HTML page inside the HTTP response exactly as if it were a static page.

                        (5) The <jsp: useBean> element is used to access the bean in jsp. This element instantiates an object of the bean class specified by class name & binds it to an object with the name specified. A new object is instantiated only if only if there is no existing one with the same ID & scope. The useBean action creates a Java object in a specified scope. The object is also made available in the current JSP page as a scripting variable. The syntax for the useBean action is: <jsp:useBean id= "beanobjname" class="className " | beanName=―className " scope="page | request | session | application‖ > </jsp:useBean> The setProperty action can be used in conjunction with the useBean action to set the properties of a bean. We can even get the container to populate the bean properties from the request parameters without specifying the property names. In such cases the container will match the bean property names with the request parameter names. The syntax for the setProperty action is shown below: <jsp:setProperty name=―BeanObj" property="*" | property="propertyName" | [param="paramName" value="value―] /> The getProperty action can be used in conjunction with the useBean action to get the value of the properties of the bean defined by the useBean action. For example: <jsp:getProperty name=―BeanObj" property="firstName"/>

                            (5) The <jsp: useBean> element is used to access the bean in jsp. This element instantiates an object of the bean class specified by class name & binds it to an object with the name specified. A new object is instantiated only if only if there is no existing one with the same ID & scope. The useBean action creates a Java object in a specified scope. The object is also made available in the current JSP page as a scripting variable. The syntax for the useBean action is: <jsp:useBean id= "beanobjname" class="className " | beanName=―className " scope="page | request | session | application‖ > </jsp:useBean> The setProperty action can be used in conjunction with the useBean action to set the properties of a bean. We can even get the container to populate the bean properties from the request parameters without specifying the property names. In such cases the container will match the bean property names with the request parameter names. The syntax for the setProperty action is shown below: <jsp:setProperty name=―BeanObj" property="*" | property="propertyName" | [param="paramName" value="value―] /> The getProperty action can be used in conjunction with the useBean action to get the value of the properties of the bean defined by the useBean action. For example: <jsp:getProperty name=―BeanObj" property="firstName"/>

                        (5) The Expression Language (EL) simplifies the accessibility of data stored in the Java Bean component, and other objects like request, session, application etc. There are many implicit objects, operators and reserve words in EL. It can be used for the following cases: To fetch the parameter from another jsp file as: ${ param.name } To perform arithmetic operators: e.g. 5*5+4: ${5*5+4} To perform logical operator as: true and true: ${true and true} To perform relational operator as: 3.2>=2: ${3.2>=2} To perform conditional operator as: The result of 10>2 is: "${(10>1)?'greater':'lesser'}" To perform empty operator as: The Value for the Empty operator is:: ${empty ""}<br> Types of Expressions • The unified EL provides 2 types of expressions: – Value Expression – Method Expression  Value Expression: It is further categorized as: • Rvalue expressions: can only read data, but cannot write data. Expressions that use immediate evaluation syntax are always rvalue expressions. • Lvalue expressions: can read and write data. Expressions that use deferred evaluation syntax can act as both rvalue and lvalue expressions.  Method Expressions: • A JSF component uses method expressions, Which in turn invokes methods that do some processing on behalf of the component element. • For std. components, these methods are necessary for handling events that the components generates as well as validating component data.  Using EL Expressions: It can be used in 2 situations: As attribute values in std. and custom actions. In template text such as HTML or non-JSP elements, in the JSP file.

                    <div class="answer-text">
                        (5) An EJB JAR file is portable and can be used for various applications. EJB 3.0 required packaging:      Web application in a WAR file – Web application archive EJB’s package in a JAR file – java archive WAR and JAR files into an EAR file – Enterprise application archive To assemble a Java EE application, package one or more modules into an EAR file, the archive file that holds the application. When deploying the EAR file that contains the enterprise bean's EJB JAR file, you also deploy the enterprise bean to GlassFish Server. You can also deploy an EJB JAR that is not contained in an EAR file. Figure shows the contents of an EJB JAR file. Packaging Enterprise Beans in WAR Modules        Enterprise beans often provide the business logic of a web application. In these cases, packaging the enterprise bean within the web application's WAR module simplifies deployment and application organization. To include enterprise bean class files in a WAR module, the class files should be in the WEB-INF/classes directory. To include a JAR file that contains enterprise beans in a WAR module, add the JAR to the WEB-INF/lib directory of the WAR module. WAR modules that contain enterprise beans do not require an ejb-jar.xml deployment descriptor. If the application uses ejb-jar.xml, it must be located in the WAR module's WEB-INF directory. For example, suppose that a web application consists of a shopping cart enterprise bean, a credit card–processing enterprise bean, and a Java servlet front end. The shopping cart bean exposes a local, no-interface view and is defined as follows: package com.example.cart; @Stateless public class CartBean { ... } The credit card–processing bean is packaged within its own JAR file, cc.jar, exposes a local, no-interface view, and is defined as follows: package com.example.cc; @Stateless public class CreditCardBean { ... } The servlet, com.example.web.StoreServlet, handles the web front end and uses both CartBean and CreditCardBean. The WAR module layout for this application is as follows: WEB-INF/classes/com/example/cart/CartBean.class WEB-INF/classes/com/example/web/StoreServlet WEB-INF/lib/cc.jar WEB-INF/ejb-jar.xml WEB-INF/web.xml

                                (5) An EJB JAR file is portable and can be used for various applications. EJB 3.0 required packaging:      Web application in a WAR file – Web application archive EJB’s package in a JAR file – java archive WAR and JAR files into an EAR file – Enterprise application archive To assemble a Java EE application, package one or more modules into an EAR file, the archive file that holds the application. When deploying the EAR file that contains the enterprise bean's EJB JAR file, you also deploy the enterprise bean to GlassFish Server. You can also deploy an EJB JAR that is not contained in an EAR file. Figure shows the contents of an EJB JAR file.

                        (5) Defining an Interceptor • Interceptor methods can be used to intercept either a business method or lifecycle event. • An interceptor that intercepts a business method is typically called an AroundInvoke method because it can be defined by annotating the method with an @AroundInvoke annotation. • An AroundInvoke method can be defined on: • • Enterprise bean class • Interceptor class An interceptor class is a normal java class. It does not need to extend any special class or implement any interface. AroundInvoke Method • It can be defined by either of the following methods: • Annotating the method with an @AroundInvoke annotation. • Using an element in the bean’s deployment descriptor. It must satisfy the following requirements: • One AroundInvoke method is allowed for each class. • It must have a no argument public constructor. • It must accept an javax.interceptor.InvocationCOntext object as an argument and return a java.lang.Object object. • It can throw any application exception that is specified in the business interface or any runtime exception. • It can be declared private, package private, protected or public.

                        (5) Java Persistence API with specification: 1. Java Persistence API is a specification, which is released under Java EE 5 specification. 2. It is neither an implementation nor a product. Hence, it cannot be used as it is for persistence. It needs an ORM implementation to work with and persist Java Objects. 3. Technically, JPA is just a set of interfaces [a Specification] and thus requires an implementation. 4. All specifications require vendors or open source projects to implement them. Using JPA therefore requires picking up an implementation [ORM tool such as Hibernate, Toplink, OpenJPA or any other ORM that implements JPA]. 5. JPA defines the interface that an implementation has to implement. 6. The whole point of having a standard interface is that users can, in principle, switch between implementations of JPA without changing their code. 7. This way, JPA helps prevent Vendor Lock-In by relying on a strict specification such as JDO and EJB 2.x entities. 8. Currently most of the persistence vendors[ORM tool providers] have released implementations of JPA. 9. Since, the Java Persistence code spec covers several persistence frameworks into a single API, an application written using JPA will work across several implementations [Hibernate, Toplink and so on]. This is very useful, especially when, development begins using the free open source ORM implementations and later on when the need arises, the open source implementation is swapped with a commercial ORM implementation. The switch happens without changing the application code spec.

                            (5) Java Persistence API with specification: 1. Java Persistence API is a specification, which is released under Java EE 5 specification. 2. It is neither an implementation nor a product. Hence, it cannot be used as it is for persistence. It needs an ORM implementation to work with and persist Java Objects. 3. Technically, JPA is just a set of interfaces [a Specification] and thus requires an implementation. 4. All specifications require vendors or open source projects to implement them. Using JPA therefore requires picking up an implementation [ORM tool such as Hibernate, Toplink, OpenJPA or any other ORM that implements JPA]. 5. JPA defines the interface that an implementation has to implement. 6. The whole point of having a standard interface is that users can, in principle, switch between implementations of JPA without changing their code. 7. This way, JPA helps prevent Vendor Lock-In by relying on a strict specification such as JDO and EJB 2.x entities. 8. Currently most of the persistence vendors[ORM tool providers] have released implementations of JPA. 9. Since, the Java Persistence code spec covers several persistence frameworks into a single API, an application written using JPA will work across several implementations [Hibernate, Toplink and so on]. This is very useful, especially when, development begins using the free open source ORM implementations and later on when the need arises, the open source implementation is swapped with a commercial ORM implementation. The switch happens without changing the application code spec.

Components of Hibernate: • Connection Management: provides efficient management of the database connection. Database connection is the most expensive part of an application that allows interacting with the database. • Transaction Management: provides ability to execute more than one database statements at a time. • Object Relational Mapping: is a technique of mapping the data representation from an object model to a relational model.

                            (5) An xml mapping document is created, which informs hibernate about: • The classes needed to store the data. • How the classes are related to the tables & columns in the database. • The mapping document is compiled, when the application starts up. • It provides the framework with all the necessary information. • During the runtime, hibernate reads the xml mapping document and dynamically builds java classes to manage the translation between the database and java objects. • A session factory is created from the compiled collection of mapping document. • The session class provides the interface between the persistence data store and the application. • All the database interaction is done via a simple, native API that hibernate provides. Components of Hibernate: • Connection Management: provides efficient management of the database connection. Database connection is the most expensive part of an application that allows interacting with the database. • Transaction Management: provides ability to execute more than one database statements at a time. • Object Relational Mapping: is a technique of mapping the data representation from an object model to a relational model. This part is used to perform CRUD operations from the underlying database tables. Hibernate sits between traditional Java objects and database server to handle all the works in persisting those objects based on the appropriate O/R mechanisms and patterns.

                        (5) A JDBC RowSet object holds tabular data in a way that makes it more flexible and easier to use than a result set. Oracle has defined five RowSet interfaces for some of the more popular uses of a RowSet, and standard reference are available for these RowSet interfaces. These versions of the RowSet interface and their implementations have been provided as a convenience for programmers. Programmers are free to write their own versions of the javax.sql.RowSet interface, to extend the implementations of the five RowSet interfaces, or to write their own implementations. The following interfaces extend RowSet interface: • JdbcRowSet: It is a connected rowset that makes a JDBC driver look like a JavaBeans component. • CachedRowSet: it is a container for rows of data that caches its rows in memory, which makes it possible to operate without always being connected to its data source. • WebRowSet: It is a disconnected rowset that caches its data in memory in the same manner as a CachedRowSet object. As a consequence, a WebRowSet object fills a real need by making it easy for web services to send and receive data from a database in the form of an XML document. • JoinRowSet: It provides a mechanism for combining related data from different RowSet objects into one JoinRowSet object, which represents an SQL JOIN . In other words, a JoinRowSet object acts as a container for the data from RowSet objects that form an SQL JOIN relationship. • FilteredRowSet: It provides the reference implementation which may be extended if required. Alternatively, a vendor is free to implement its own version by implementing this interface. Q2 Attempt any three of the following: (15)

                        [5] Ans. The life cycle of a servlet application consists of four phases: 1. Initialization: When a servlet container initializes a servlet, it creates an instance of the servlet and calls its int() method. This phase is executed only once during the lifetime of a servlet. 2. Request Handling: Once the servlet is initialized, it is ready to handle client requests. When a client sends a request to the servlet, the servlet container creates a new thread to handle the request and calls the service() method of the servlet. The service() method processes the request and generates a response. 3. Response Generation: After the service() method has finished processing the request, it generates a response and sends it back to the client. 4. Destroy: When the servlet container decides to remove a servlet, it calls the destroy() method of the servlet. This phase is executed only once during the lifetime of a servlet. During the destroy() method, the servlet can release any resources it has allocated and perform any cleanup operations.

                        accessing relational databases. The Statement interface is a sub-interface of the JDBC Statement interface, which is used to execute SQL statements against a database. The Statement object is used to send SQL statements to the database and receive the results.  There are three types of JDBC Statement objects: 1. Statement: This is the simplest type of Statement object, which is used to execute a single SQL statement that doesn't have any parameters. The Statement object is created using the createStatement() method of the Connection interface. 2. PreparedStatement: This type of Statement object is used to execute a precompiled SQL statement that may have one or more parameters. The PreparedStatement object is created using the prepareStatement() method of the Connection interface. 3. CallableStatement: This type of Statement object is used to execute stored procedures that are defined in the database. A stored procedure is a set of SQL statements that are stored in the database and can be executed by a client application. The CallableStatement object is created using the prepareCall() method of the Connection interface.

                        [5] Ans.  A session is a way to maintain state information between HTTP requests for a single user or client.  Sessions are typically used to store user-specific data, such as shopping cart items or login credentials, that needs to persist across multiple requests.  Session management involves the creation, maintenance, and destruction of sessions.  The following are some rules for session management: 1. Session ID generation: A unique session ID should be generated for each new session. This ID should be difficult to guess or predict to prevent session hijacking attacks. 2. Session ID storage: The session ID should be stored in a cookie or in the URL. If stored in a cookie, the cookie should be marked as secure and HttpOnly to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. 3. Session timeout: Sessions should have a timeout period to prevent them from being active indefinitely. The timeout period should be long enough to allow users to complete their tasks, but short enough to prevent sessions from being hijacked. 4. Session data storage: Session data should be stored on the server side, not on the client side. This prevents users from tampering with the session data and allows the server to control the lifetime of the session. 5. Session termination: Sessions should be terminated when the user logs out or when the session timeout period is reached. This ensures that session data is not left active for longer than necessary.

                                [5] Ans.  A session is a way to maintain state information between HTTP requests for a single user or client.  Sessions are typically used to store user-specific data, such as shopping cart items or login credentials, that needs to persist across multiple requests.  Session management involves the creation, maintenance, and destruction of sessions.  The following are some rules for session management: 1. Session ID generation: A unique session ID should be generated for each new session. This ID should be difficult to guess or predict to prevent session hijacking attacks. 2. Session ID storage: The session ID should be stored in a cookie or in the URL. If stored in a cookie, the cookie should be marked as secure and HttpOnly to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. 3. Session timeout: Sessions should have a timeout period to prevent them from being active indefinitely. The timeout period should be long enough to allow users to complete their tasks, but short enough to prevent sessions from being hijacked. 4. Session data storage: Session data should be stored on the server side, not on the client side. This prevents users from tampering with the session data and allows the server to control the lifetime of the session. 5. Session termination: Sessions should be terminated when the user logs out or when the session timeout period is reached. This ensures that session data is not left active for longer than necessary.

                        [5] Ans.  Non-blocking I/O is a technique that allows a program to perform I/O operations without blocking the execution of the program.  Non-blocking I/O is useful in situations where the program needs to perform I/O operations on multiple input/output streams simultaneously.  In non-blocking I/O, the program initiates an I/O operation and then continues executing other code without waiting for the I/O operation to complete.  When the I/O operation is complete, the program is notified and can then process the data that was read or written.  Non-blocking I/O works by using a special system call that allows the program to check if an I/O operation can be performed without blocking.  If an I/O operation can be performed without blocking, the program can initiate the operation and continue executing other code.  If an I/O operation would block, the program can choose to wait for the operation to complete or continue executing other code.  Non-blocking I/O is often used in network programming to handle multiple connections simultaneously. By using non-blocking I/O, a program can process data from multiple network connections without blocking on any one connection.  This can improve the performance of network applications and allow them to handle more connections simultaneously.

                        uploading code in servlet? [5] Ans.  When writing file uploading code in a servlet, there are several things that need to be carefully checked and understood to ensure that the code is secure and reliable: 1. Request method: The file upload request must use the POST method, as other methods like GET or HEAD do not support file uploads. 2. Encoding type: The encoding type of the request must be set to "multipart/form-data", which allows binary data to be included in the request body. 3. File size: The maximum file size that can be uploaded should be limited to prevent denial of service attacks and to ensure that the server has enough resources to handle the request. 4. File type: The file type should be validated to ensure that only allowed file types are uploaded. This can be done by checking the file extension or by checking the MIME type of the file. 5. File name: The file name should be sanitized to prevent directory traversal attacks. The file name should also be checked for length to prevent buffer overflow attacks. 6. File storage: The uploaded file should be stored in a secure location on the server, and the file should be given a unique name to prevent conflicts with other files. 7. Error handling: The servlet should handle errors gracefully and provide informative error messages to the user. This can include checking for file upload errors, file size errors, and file type errors. 8. Security: The servlet should be protected against cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. Q3. Attempt any three of the following [15]

                        Ans.  Server pages are used for following: 1) Extension to Servlet: JSP technology is the extension to Servlet technology. We can use all the features of the Servlet in JSP. In addition to, we can use implicit objects, predefined tags, expression language and Custom tags in JSP that makes JSP development easy. 2) Easy to maintain: The business logic with presentation logic is separated in JSP so we can easily managed web application.In Servlet technology, we mix our business logic with the presentation logic. 3) Fast Development: No need to recompile and redeploy .If JSP page is modified, we don't need to recompile and redeploy the project. The Servlet code needs to be updated and recompiled if we have to change the look and feel of the application. 4) Less code than Servlet: In JSP, we can use many tags such as action tags, JSTL, custom tags, etc. that reduces the code. Moreover, we can use EL, implicit objects, etc. JSP JSP is an interface on top of servlet and it is SERVLET Servlet is server-side program. "translated" into java code. JSP run slower. Servlet run faster. In MVC architecture JSP acts as view. In MVC architecture act as controller. It is easy to code in JSP Coding is little more difficult in servlet JSP compiled into a java servlet before Servlet execute inside a web server execution.

                        [5] Ans.  The life cycle of a JSP page is as follows: 1. Translation: When a JSP page is accessed for the first time, it is translated into a servlet by the JSP container. The JSP container creates a servlet class that extends the HttpServlet class and contains the code for the JSP page. 2. Compilation: The servlet class is then compiled into bytecode by the Java compiler. 3. Initialization: The JSP container creates an instance of the servlet class and calls its init() method. This method is used to perform any initialization tasks that need to be done before the servlet can handle requests. 4. Request handling: When a client sends a request to the JSP page, the JSP container calls the service() method of the servlet class. This method handles the request and generates the response. 5. Destruction: When the JSP container shuts down or the JSP page is removed, the container calls the destroy() method of the servlet class. This method is used to perform any cleanup tasks that need to be done before the servlet is destroyed. 6. Recompile: If the JSP page is modified, the JSP container recompiles it into a servlet and replaces the old servlet with the new one. This allows the JSP page to be updated without restarting the server.

                        [5] Ans.  The jsp:useBean action tag is used to create an instance of a JavaBean and store it as a variable in the page context, session context, or request context  . The attributes of the jsp:useBean tag are as follows: 1. id: This attribute is used to specify the name of the variable that will store the instance of the JavaBean. 2. class: This attribute is used to specify the fully qualified class name of the JavaBean. 3. scope: This attribute is used to specify the scope of the variable that will store the instance of the JavaBean. The possible values for this attribute are page, request, session, and application. 4. type: This attribute is used to specify the data type of the variable that will store the instance of the JavaBean. This is an optional attribute and is only used when the type of the variable cannot be inferred from the class attribute.  The jsp:useBean tag is typically used in conjunction with the jsp:setProperty and jsp:getProperty tags to set and get the properties of the JavaBean.  For example, the following code creates an instance of the Customer JavaBean and sets its properties: <jsp:useBean id="customer" class="com.example.Customer" scope="session"/> <jsp:setProperty name="customer" property="firstName" value="John"/> <jsp:setProperty name="customer" property="lastName" value="Doe"/>  The customer variable is then stored in the session context and can be accessed by other JSP pages or servlets.

                        [5] Ans.  The <jsp:plugin> action tag is used to embed applets or other types of plugins in a JSP page.  The <jsp:plugin> tag has several attributes that can be used to specify the parameters and properties of the plugin, including the codebase, code, type, width, height, and archive attributes.  For example, the following code embeds an applet in a JSP page using the <jsp:plugin> tag: <jsp:plugin type="applet" code="com.example.Applet" width="400" height="300"> <jsp:params> <jsp:param name="param1" value="value1"/> <jsp:param name="param2" value="value2"/> </jsp:params> </jsp:plugin>  This code embeds an applet with the class name "com.example.Applet" and a width and height of 400 and 300 pixels, respectively.  The <jsp:params> tag is used to specify the parameters that will be passed to the applet.  The <jsp:plugin> tag is a powerful tool for embedding plugins in a JSP page, but it should be used with caution as plugins can pose security risks.  It is important to ensure that plugins are up-to-date and that they are only used when necessary.

                            [5] Ans.  The <jsp:plugin> action tag is used to embed applets or other types of plugins in a JSP page.  The <jsp:plugin> tag has several attributes that can be used to specify the parameters and properties of the plugin, including the codebase, code, type, width, height, and archive attributes.  For example, the following code embeds an applet in a JSP page using the <jsp:plugin> tag: <jsp:plugin type="applet" code="com.example.Applet" width="400" height="300"> <jsp:params> <jsp:param name="param1" value="value1"/> <jsp:param name="param2" value="value2"/> </jsp:params> </jsp:plugin>  This code embeds an applet with the class name "com.example.Applet" and a width and height of 400 and 300 pixels, respectively.  The <jsp:params> tag is used to specify the parameters that will be passed to the applet.  The <jsp:plugin> tag is a powerful tool for embedding plugins in a JSP page, but it should be used with caution as plugins can pose security risks.  It is important to ensure that plugins are up-to-date and that they are only used when necessary.

                        [5] Ans.  JSTL stands for JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library, which is a collection of JSP tags that encapsulate core functionality common to many JSP applications.  JSTL provides a set of tags that can be used to perform common tasks such as looping over collections, formatting data, and conditional processing.  JSTL is designed to simplify JSP development by providing a standard set of tags that can be used across different JSP containers.  XPath is a language used for selecting nodes from an XML document.  XPath is used to navigate through elements and attributes in an XML document and is used by many XML-related technologies, including XSLT, XQuery, and XML Schema. XPath uses a path-like syntax to identify nodes in an XML document.  XPath expressions are used to select nodes in an XML document.  XPath expressions can be used to select nodes based on their name, value, or position in the document.  XPath expressions are evaluated against an XML document and return a set of nodes that match the expression.  XPath expressions can use a variety of operators and functions to select nodes.

Some of the advantages of EJB include: 1. Scalability: EJB provides a scalable architecture that can handle large volumes of transactions and users. 2. Transaction management: EJB provides built-in support for transaction management, which simplifies the development of transactional applications. 3. Security: EJB provides a robust security model that can be used to secure applications against unauthorized access. 4. Persistence: EJB provides support for persistence, which allows data to be stored and retrieved from a database. 5. Reusability: EJB components can be easily reused in different applications, which reduces development time and improves code quality. 6. Portability: EJB components can be deployed on any application server that supports the EJB specification, which provides platform independence.

                        business logic of an application.  There are three types of Session Beans: Stateful Session Beans, Stateless Session Beans, and Singleton Session Beans. 1. Stateful Session Beans: Stateful Session Beans are used to maintain the conversational state of a client. When a client interacts with a Stateful Session Bean, the bean maintains the state of the conversation between the client and the server. This allows the client to continue the conversation with the server across multiple requests. 2. Stateless Session Beans: Stateless Session Beans are used to perform a specific task or operation. When a client interacts with a Stateless Session Bean, the bean performs the requested operation and returns the result to the client 3. Singleton Session Beans: Singleton Session Beans are used to maintain a single instance of a bean across multiple clients. When a client interacts with a Singleton Session Bean, the bean performs the requested operation and returns the result to the client.

                        to asynchronously process messages from a messaging system.  Here are some characteristics of MDBs: 1. Asynchronous Processing: MDBs are designed to process messages asynchronously. When a message is received, the container invokes the onMessage() method of the MDB to process the message. This allows the application to continue processing other requests while the message is being processed. 2. Message Driven: MDBs are designed to process messages from a messaging system. A messaging system is a platform-independent communication mechanism that allows applications to exchange messages. MDBs can be used with messaging systems such as Java Message Service (JMS) and Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP). 3. No Client Dependency: MDBs do not have a client dependency. This means that MDBs can be invoked by any client that sends messages to the messaging system. This allows the application to be more flexible and scalable. 4. Stateless: MDBs are stateless. This means that the container can reuse the same instance of the MDB to process multiple messages. This reduces the overhead of creating and destroying instances of the MDB. 5. Configurable: MDBs are configurable. The container allows you to configure the number of instances of the MDB that can be created to process messages. This allows you to optimize the performance of the application.

                        [5] Ans.  Hibernate is an open-source object-relational mapping (ORM) framework for the Java programming language.  It provides a way to map Java objects to relational database tables, and vice versa. Hibernate is widely used in enterprise applications to simplify database programming and improve performance.  Some of the key features of Hibernate include: 1. Object-relational mapping: Hibernate provides a way to map Java objects to relational database tables, and vice versa. This allows developers to work with objects in their programming language, rather than dealing with low-level SQL queries. 2. Database independence: Hibernate provides a database-independent way to work with the database. This means that you can write your application code once, and it will work with any database that Hibernate supports. 3. Caching: Hibernate provides a caching mechanism that can be used to improve performance. Hibernate can cache frequently accessed data in memory, reducing the number of database queries required. 4. Lazy loading: Hibernate supports lazy loading, which means that it only loads data from the database when it is needed. This can help to reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred from the database to the application. 5. Transactions: Hibernate provides a way to manage database transactions in a consistent and reliable way. This helps to ensure that the data in the database remains consistent and accurate.

                            [5] Ans.  Hibernate is an open-source object-relational mapping (ORM) framework for the Java programming language.  It provides a way to map Java objects to relational database tables, and vice versa. Hibernate is widely used in enterprise applications to simplify database programming and improve performance.  Some of the key features of Hibernate include: 1. Object-relational mapping: Hibernate provides a way to map Java objects to relational database tables, and vice versa. This allows developers to work with objects in their programming language, rather than dealing with low-level SQL queries. 2. Database independence: Hibernate provides a database-independent way to work with the database. This means that you can write your application code once, and it will work with any database that Hibernate supports. 3. Caching: Hibernate provides a caching mechanism that can be used to improve performance. Hibernate can cache frequently accessed data in memory, reducing the number of database queries required. 4. Lazy loading: Hibernate supports lazy loading, which means that it only loads data from the database when it is needed. This can help to reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred from the database to the application. 5. Transactions: Hibernate provides a way to manage database transactions in a consistent and reliable way. This helps to ensure that the data in the database remains consistent and accurate.

                        [5] Ans. The main components of Hibernate configuration are: 1. SessionFactory: The SessionFactory is responsible for creating and managing sessions. It is a thread-safe object that should be created once per application. The SessionFactory is used to create new sessions, which are used to interact with the database. 2. Database connection details: Hibernate needs to know how to connect to the database. This includes details such as the JDBC driver class name, the database URL, the username, and the password. 3. Mapping files: Hibernate uses mapping files to map Java objects to database tables. These mapping files define how each Java class is mapped to a database table, and how each property of the Java class is mapped to a column in the database table. 4. Hibernate configuration properties: Hibernate has many configuration properties that can be used to customize its behavior. These properties can be used to configure things such as the cache provider, the transaction manager, and the dialect used to generate SQL statements. 5. Hibernate query language (HQL) configuration: HQL is a powerful query language that is used to retrieve data from the database. Hibernate configuration includes settings for HQL, such as the dialect used to generate SQL statements.

                        e. Explain using a code snippet the onDataAvailable() and onAllDataRead() methods of ReadListener interface. (5) 1) ReadListener interface - servlet package contains a number of classes and interfaces that describe and define the contracts between a servlet class and the runtime environment provided for an instance of such a class by a conforming servlet container. This class represents a call-back mechanism that will notify implementations as HTTP request data becomes available to be read without blocking. 2) onDataAvailable() - void onDataAvailable() throws IOException When an instance of the ReadListener is registered with a ServletInputStream, this method will be invoked by the container the first time when it is possible to read data. Subsequently the container will invoke this method if and only if ServletInputStream.isReady() method has been called and has returned false. Throws: IOException - if an I/O related error has occurred during processing − @Override public void setReadListener( ReadListener readListener ) { this.readListener = readListener; try { readListener.onDataAvailable(); } catch ( IOException e ) { } } } 3) onAllDataRead() - void onDataAvailable() throws IOException − When an instance of the ReadListener is registered with a ServletInputStream, this method will be invoked by the container the first time when it is possible to read data.

                            e. Explain using a code snippet the onDataAvailable() and onAllDataRead() methods of ReadListener interface. (5) 1) ReadListener interface - servlet package contains a number of classes and interfaces that describe and define the contracts between a servlet class and the runtime environment provided for an instance of such a class by a conforming servlet container. This class represents a call-back mechanism that will notify implementations as HTTP request data becomes available to be read without blocking. 2) onDataAvailable() - void onDataAvailable() throws IOException When an instance of the ReadListener is registered with a ServletInputStream, this method will be invoked by the container the first time when it is possible to read data. Subsequently the container will invoke this method if and only if ServletInputStream.isReady() method has been called and has returned false. Throws: IOException - if an I/O related error has occurred during processing − @Override public void setReadListener( ReadListener readListener ) { this.readListener = readListener; try { readListener.onDataAvailable(); } catch ( IOException e ) { } } } 3) onAllDataRead() - void onDataAvailable() throws IOException − When an instance of the ReadListener is registered with a ServletInputStream, this method will be invoked by the container the first time when it is possible to read data. Subsequently the container will invoke this method if and only if ServletInputStream.isReady() method has been called and has returned false. − Throws: IOException - if an I/O related error has occurred during processing @Override public int read() throws IOException { if ( bytes.length > position ) {

                        3. Attempt any three of the following: a. Explain the reasons to use JSP. (5) 1) Compilation - Java server pages JSP are always compiled before its processed by the server as it reduces the effort of the server to create process. 2) Fast Development – No need to recompile and redeploy. If JSP page is modified, we don’t need to recompile and redeploy the project. The Servlet code needs to be updated and recompiled if we have to change the look and feel of the application. 3) Less code than Servlet – In JSP, we can use many tags such as action tags, JSTL, custom tags, etc, that reduces the code. Moreover, we can use EL, implicit objects, etc. 4) Easy to maintain – The business logic with presentation logic is separated in JSP so we can easily managed web application. In Servlet technology, we mix our business logic with the presentation logic. 5) Extension to Servlet – Jsp technology is the extension to Servlet Technology. We can use all the features of the Servlet in JSP. In addition to, we can use implicit objects, predefined tags, expression language and Custom tags in JSP that makes JSP development easy. b. What are directives? Explain page directive with any of its four attributes. (5) − A JSP directive affects the overall structure of the servlet class.

                            3. Attempt any three of the following: a. Explain the reasons to use JSP. (5) 1) Compilation - Java server pages JSP are always compiled before its processed by the server as it reduces the effort of the server to create process. 2) Fast Development – No need to recompile and redeploy. If JSP page is modified, we don’t need to recompile and redeploy the project. The Servlet code needs to be updated and recompiled if we have to change the look and feel of the application. 3) Less code than Servlet – In JSP, we can use many tags such as action tags, JSTL, custom tags, etc, that reduces the code. Moreover, we can use EL, implicit objects, etc. 4) Easy to maintain – The business logic with presentation logic is separated in JSP so we can easily managed web application. In Servlet technology, we mix our business logic with the presentation logic. 5) Extension to Servlet – Jsp technology is the extension to Servlet Technology. We can use all the features of the Servlet in JSP. In addition to, we can use implicit objects, predefined tags, expression language and Custom tags in JSP that makes JSP development easy. b. What are directives? Explain page directive with any of its four attributes. (5) − A JSP directive affects the overall structure of the servlet class. It usually has the following form − <%@ directive attribute = "value" %> − Directives can have a number of attributes which you can list down as keyvalue pairs and separated by commas. − The blanks between the @ symbol and the directive name, and between the last attribute and the closing %>, are optional. − There are three types of directive tag – S.No. Directive & Description <%@ page ... %> Defines page-dependent attributes, such as scripting language, error page, and buffering requirements. <%@ include ... %> Includes a file during the translation phase. <%@ taglib ... %> Declares a tag library, containing custom actions, used in the page − JSP - The page Directive − The page directive is used to provide instructions to the container. These instructions pertain to the current JSP page. You may code page directives anywhere in your JSP page. By convention, page directives are coded at the top of the JSP page. Following is the basic syntax of the page directive − <%@ page attribute = "value" %> You can write the XML equivalent of the above syntax as follows − <jsp:directive.page attribute = "value" /> Attributes Following table lists out the attributes associated with the page directive – S.No. Attribute & Purpose buffer Specifies a buffering model for the output stream. errorPage Defines the URL of another JSP that reports on Java unchecked runtime exceptions. isErrorPage Indicates if this JSP page is a URL specified by another JSP page's errorPage attribute. extends Specifies a superclass that the generated servlet must extend. import Specifies a list of packages or classes for use in the JSP as the Java import statement does for Java classes. c. Develop a simple JSP application to accept values from html page and display on next page. (Name-txt, age-txt, hobbies-checkbox, email-txt,

What is an interceptor? How an interceptor is defined and how aroundInvoke () is added to it? (5) − Interceptors are used to implement cross-cutting concerns, such as logging, auditing, and security, from the business logic. − Interceptors are used, as the name suggests, when you want to intercept calls to EJB methods. If you declare an Interceptor for a Bean, every time a method of that Bean is invoked, it will be intercepted with one method of the Interceptor. That means that the execution goes straight to the Interceptor’s method. The intercepting method then, can decide whether to call the intercepted EJB method or simply replace it. − You might find the above behavior resembling the Aspect Oriented Programming philosophy, and you’d be correct. Despite the fact that the implementation of the two technologies is completely different, the truth is they can be used for the same purposes. For example, when you want to log something before of after a Beans method is executed. Or when you want to enforce a specific policy concerning method calls, e.g. authentication, input checking etc. Of course an EJB can have a chain of Interceptors that will intercept the method in a specific order. − In Java EE 5, Interceptors were allowed only on EJBs. In Java EE 6, Interceptors became a new specification of its own, abstracted at a higher level so that it can be more generically applied to a broader set of specifications in the platform. − Interceptor method in bean class − Take a look at EmailMDB.java. It contains this method: @AroundInvoke

What is an interceptor? How an interceptor is defined and how aroundInvoke () is added to it? (5) − Interceptors are used to implement cross-cutting concerns, such as logging, auditing, and security, from the business logic. − Interceptors are used, as the name suggests, when you want to intercept calls to EJB methods. If you declare an Interceptor for a Bean, every time a method of that Bean is invoked, it will be intercepted with one method of the Interceptor. That means that the execution goes straight to the Interceptor’s method. The intercepting method then, can decide whether to call the intercepted EJB method or simply replace it. − You might find the above behavior resembling the Aspect Oriented Programming philosophy, and you’d be correct. Despite the fact that the implementation of the two technologies is completely different, the truth is they can be used for the same purposes. For example, when you want to log something before of after a Beans method is executed. Or when you want to enforce a specific policy concerning method calls, e.g. authentication, input checking etc. Of course an EJB can have a chain of Interceptors that will intercept the method in a specific order. − In Java EE 5, Interceptors were allowed only on EJBs. In Java EE 6, Interceptors became a new specification of its own, abstracted at a higher level so that it can be more generically applied to a broader set of specifications in the platform. − Interceptor method in bean class − Take a look at EmailMDB.java. It contains this method: @AroundInvoke

                        objects directly to and from the database. Hibernate supports Inheritence, Association relations, and Collections. Abstract away the unfamiliar SQL types and provides a way to work around familiar Java Objects. Hibernate does not require an application server to operate. e. Explain using suitable diagram architecture of Hibernate. (5) − Hibernate uses various existing Java APIs, like JDBC, Java Transaction API(JTA), and Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI). JDBC provides a rudimentary level of abstraction of functionality common to relational databases, allowing almost any database with a JDBC driver to be supported by Hibernate. JNDI and JTA allow Hibernate to be integrated with J2EE application servers. − Following section gives brief description of each of the class objects involved in Hibernate Application Architecture. − Configuration Object − The Configuration object is the first Hibernate object you create in any Hibernate application. It is usually created only once during application initialization. It represents a configuration or properties file required by the Hibernate. − The Configuration object provides two keys components − − Database Connection – This is handled through one or more configuration file supported by Hibernate. These files are hibernate.properties and hibernate.cfg.xml. − Class Mapping Setup − This component creates the connection between the Java classes and database tables. − SessionFactory Object − Configuration object is used to create a SessionFactory object which in turn configures Hibernate for the application using the supplied configuration file and allows for a Session object to be instantiated. The SessionFactory is a thread safe object and used by all the threads of an application. − The SessionFactory is a heavyweight object; it is usually created during application start up and kept for later use. You would need one SessionFactory object per database using a separate configuration file. So, if you are using multiple databases, then you would have to create multiple SessionFactory objects. − Session Object − A Session is used to get a physical connection with a database. The Session object is lightweight and designed to be instantiated each time an interaction is needed with the database. Persistent objects are saved and retrieved through a Session object. − The session objects should not be kept open for a long time because they are not usually thread safe and they should be created and destroyed them as needed. − Transaction Object − A Transaction represents a unit of work with the database and most of the RDBMS supports transaction functionality. Transactions in Hibernate are handled by an underlying transaction manager and transaction (from JDBC or JTA). − This is an optional object and Hibernate applications may choose not to use this interface, instead managing transactions in their own application code. − Query Object − Query objects use SQL or Hibernate Query Language (HQL) string to retrieve data from the database and create objects. A Query instance is used to bind query parameters, limit the number of results returned by the query, and finally to execute the query. − Criteria Object − Criteria objects are used to create and execute object oriented criteria queries to retrieve objects. f.

Explain using suitable diagram architecture of Hibernate. (5) − Hibernate uses various existing Java APIs, like JDBC, Java Transaction API(JTA), and Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI). JDBC provides a rudimentary level of abstraction of functionality common to relational databases, allowing almost any database with a JDBC driver to be supported by Hibernate. JNDI and JTA allow Hibernate to be integrated with J2EE application servers. − Following section gives brief description of each of the class objects involved in Hibernate Application Architecture. − Configuration Object − The Configuration object is the first Hibernate object you create in any Hibernate application. It is usually created only once during application initialization. It represents a configuration or properties file required by the Hibernate. − The Configuration object provides two keys components − − Database Connection – This is handled through one or more configuration file supported by Hibernate. These files are hibernate.properties and hibernate.cfg.xml. − Class Mapping Setup − This component creates the connection between the Java classes and database tables. − SessionFactory Object − Configuration object is used to create a SessionFactory object which in turn configures Hibernate for the application using the supplied configuration file and allows for a Session object to be instantiated. The SessionFactory is a thread safe object and used by all the threads of an application. − The SessionFactory is a heavyweight object; it is usually created during application start up and kept for later use. You would need one SessionFactory object per database using a separate configuration file. So, if you are using multiple databases, then you would have to create multiple SessionFactory objects. − Session Object − A Session is used to get a physical connection with a database. The Session object is lightweight and designed to be instantiated each time an interaction is needed with the database. Persistent objects are saved and retrieved through a Session object. − The session objects should not be kept open for a long time because they are not usually thread safe and they should be created and destroyed them as needed. − Transaction Object − A Transaction represents a unit of work with the database and most of the RDBMS supports transaction functionality. Transactions in Hibernate are handled by an underlying transaction manager and transaction (from JDBC or JTA). − This is an optional object and Hibernate applications may choose not to use this interface, instead managing transactions in their own application code. − Query Object − Query objects use SQL or Hibernate Query Language (HQL) string to retrieve data from the database and create objects. A Query instance is used to bind query parameters, limit the number of results returned by the query, and finally to execute the query. − Criteria Object − Criteria objects are used to create and execute object oriented criteria queries to retrieve objects. f.

What is wrong in using JSP scriptlet tag? How JSTL fixes JSP scriptlet shortcomings? ➢ What is wrong in using JSP scriptlet tag? − Scriplets are nothing but java code enclosed within <% and %> /. So the problems are: − Hard to read. − Hard to maintain. − Discourage reuse and encapsulation. − Encourage to put complex login in pages. ➢ How JSTL fixes JSP scriptlet shortcomings? − JSTL stands for JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Lirary. JSTL encapsulates core functionality of JSP application. − JSTL has support for common, structural tasks such as conditionals and iterations, tags internationalization, tags for manipulating XML documents, MUQuestionPapers.com and SQL, tags. It is also provides a framework for integrating existing custom tags with JSTL tags. 4. Attempt any three of the following: a. Explain benefits of EJB. − EJBs are reusable components o Can be reused in different parts of the system. o Can be packaged into libraries and sold. − EJBs can be combined visually using development IDEs. E.g. Visual Age, Visual Café − EJBs provides convenient abstractions so it do not require you to write: o Multi-threaded, multiple access code. o Database access code (e.g. JDBC). o Network communication code(i.e. it uses RMI) for client/server communication. o Network communication code for EJB to EJB communication. o Transaction management code. − EJBs from different businesses can interact easily. o This is because of their well-defined interfaces. b. Write a note on different types of session beans. − Types of Session Beans − Session beans are of three types: stateful, stateless, and singleton. − Stateful Session Beans − The state of an object consists of the values of its instance variables. In a stateful session bean, the instance variables represent the state of a unique client/bean session. Because the client interacts (“talks”) with its bean, this state is often called the conversational state. − As its name suggests, a session bean is similar to an interactive session. A session bean is not shared; it can have only one client, in the same way that MUQuestionPapers.com an interactive session can have only one user. When the client terminates, its session bean appears to terminate and is no longer associated with the client. − The state is retained for the duration of the client/bean session. If the client removes the bean, the session ends and the state disappears. This transient nature of the state is not a problem, however, because when the conversation between the client and the bean ends, there is no need to retain the state. − Stateless Session Beans − A stateless session bean does not maintain a conversational state with the client. When a client invokes the methods of a stateless bean, the bean’s instance variables may contain a state specific to that client but only for the duration of the invocation. When the method is finished, the client-specific state should not be retained. Clients may, however, change the state of instance variables in pooled stateless beans, and this state is held over to the next invocation of the pooled stateless bean. Except during method invocation, all instances of a stateless bean are equivalent, allowing the EJB container to assign an instance to any client. That is, the state of a stateless session bean should apply across all clients. − Because they can support multiple clients, stateless session beans can offer better scalability for applications that require large numbers of clients. Typically, an application requires fewer stateless session beans than stateful session beans to support the same number of clients. − A stateless session bean can implement a web service, but a stateful session bean cannot. − Singleton Session Beans − A singleton session bean is instantiated once per application and exists for the lifecycle of the application. Singleton session beans are designed for circumstances in which a single enterprise bean instance is shared across and concurrently accessed by clients. − Singleton session beans offer similar functionality to stateless session beans but differ from them in that there is only one singleton session bean per application, as opposed to a pool of stateless session beans, any of which may respond to a client request. Like stateless session beans, singleton session beans can implement web service endpoints. MUQuestionPapers.com − Singleton session beans maintain their state between client invocations but are not required to maintain their state across server crashes or shutdowns. − Applications that use a singleton session bean may specify that the singleton should be instantiated upon application startup, which allows the singleton to perform initialization tasks for the application. The singleton may perform cleanup tasks on application shutdown as well, because the singleton will operate throughout the lifecycle of the application. c. Explain life cycle of a message driven bean using suitable diagram. − The Life Cycle of a Message-Driven Bean − Just as the entity and session beans have well-defined life cycles, so does the MDB bean. The MDB instance’s life cycle has two states: Does Not Exist and Method-Ready Pool . The Method-Ready Pool is similar to the instance pool used for stateless session beans. Figure illustrates the states and transitions that an MDB instance goes through in its lifetime. MUQuestionPapers.com MDB life cycle − Does Not Exist − When an MDB instance is in the Does Not Exist state, it is not an instance in the memory of the system. In other words, it has not been instantiated yet. − The Method-Ready Pool − MDB instances enter the Method-Ready Pool as the container needs them. When the EJB server is first started, it may create a number of MDB instances and enter them into the Method-Ready Pool. (The actual behavior of the server depends on the implementation.) When the number of MDB instances handling incoming messages is insufficient, more can be created and added to the pool. − Transitioning to the Method-Ready Pool − When an instance transitions from the Does Not Exist state to the MethodReady Pool, three operations are performed on it. First, the bean instance is instantiated when the container invokes the Class.newInstance( ) method on the MDB class. Second, the setMessageDrivenContext( ) method is invoked by the container providing the MDB instance with a reference to it. d. Write a stateless session bean code to represent BookInformation. (BookId integer, BookName String, Pages integer, Price double). − package bookdemo; import javax.ejb.Stateless; @Stateless public class BookInfo{ private int bookId, pages; private String bookName; private double price MUQuestionPapers.com public BookInfo(){} public void setBookId(int

What is wrong in using JSP scriptlet tag? How JSTL fixes JSP scriptlet shortcomings? ➢ What is wrong in using JSP scriptlet tag? − Scriplets are nothing but java code enclosed within <% and %> /. So the problems are: − Hard to read. − Hard to maintain. − Discourage reuse and encapsulation. − Encourage to put complex login in pages. ➢ How JSTL fixes JSP scriptlet shortcomings? − JSTL stands for JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Lirary. JSTL encapsulates core functionality of JSP application. − JSTL has support for common, structural tasks such as conditionals and iterations, tags internationalization, tags for manipulating XML documents, MUQuestionPapers.com and SQL, tags. It is also provides a framework for integrating existing custom tags with JSTL tags. 4. Attempt any three of the following: a. Explain benefits of EJB. − EJBs are reusable components o Can be reused in different parts of the system. o Can be packaged into libraries and sold. − EJBs can be combined visually using development IDEs. E.g. Visual Age, Visual Café − EJBs provides convenient abstractions so it do not require you to write: o Multi-threaded, multiple access code. o Database access code (e.g. JDBC). o Network communication code(i.e. it uses RMI) for client/server communication. o Network communication code for EJB to EJB communication. o Transaction management code. − EJBs from different businesses can interact easily. o This is because of their well-defined interfaces. b. Write a note on different types of session beans. − Types of Session Beans − Session beans are of three types: stateful, stateless, and singleton. − Stateful Session Beans − The state of an object consists of the values of its instance variables. In a stateful session bean, the instance variables represent the state of a unique client/bean session. Because the client interacts (“talks”) with its bean, this state is often called the conversational state. − As its name suggests, a session bean is similar to an interactive session. A session bean is not shared; it can have only one client, in the same way that MUQuestionPapers.com an interactive session can have only one user. When the client terminates, its session bean appears to terminate and is no longer associated with the client. − The state is retained for the duration of the client/bean session. If the client removes the bean, the session ends and the state disappears. This transient nature of the state is not a problem, however, because when the conversation between the client and the bean ends, there is no need to retain the state. − Stateless Session Beans − A stateless session bean does not maintain a conversational state with the client. When a client invokes the methods of a stateless bean, the bean’s instance variables may contain a state specific to that client but only for the duration of the invocation. When the method is finished, the client-specific state should not be retained. Clients may, however, change the state of instance variables in pooled stateless beans, and this state is held over to the next invocation of the pooled stateless bean. Except during method invocation, all instances of a stateless bean are equivalent, allowing the EJB container to assign an instance to any client. That is, the state of a stateless session bean should apply across all clients. − Because they can support multiple clients, stateless session beans can offer better scalability for applications that require large numbers of clients. Typically, an application requires fewer stateless session beans than stateful session beans to support the same number of clients. − A stateless session bean can implement a web service, but a stateful session bean cannot. − Singleton Session Beans − A singleton session bean is instantiated once per application and exists for the lifecycle of the application. Singleton session beans are designed for circumstances in which a single enterprise bean instance is shared across and concurrently accessed by clients. − Singleton session beans offer similar functionality to stateless session beans but differ from them in that there is only one singleton session bean per application, as opposed to a pool of stateless session beans, any of which may respond to a client request. Like stateless session beans, singleton session beans can implement web service endpoints. MUQuestionPapers.com − Singleton session beans maintain their state between client invocations but are not required to maintain their state across server crashes or shutdowns. − Applications that use a singleton session bean may specify that the singleton should be instantiated upon application startup, which allows the singleton to perform initialization tasks for the application. The singleton may perform cleanup tasks on application shutdown as well, because the singleton will operate throughout the lifecycle of the application. c. Explain life cycle of a message driven bean using suitable diagram. − The Life Cycle of a Message-Driven Bean − Just as the entity and session beans have well-defined life cycles, so does the MDB bean. The MDB instance’s life cycle has two states: Does Not Exist and Method-Ready Pool . The Method-Ready Pool is similar to the instance pool used for stateless session beans. Figure illustrates the states and transitions that an MDB instance goes through in its lifetime. MUQuestionPapers.com MDB life cycle − Does Not Exist − When an MDB instance is in the Does Not Exist state, it is not an instance in the memory of the system. In other words, it has not been instantiated yet. − The Method-Ready Pool − MDB instances enter the Method-Ready Pool as the container needs them. When the EJB server is first started, it may create a number of MDB instances and enter them into the Method-Ready Pool. (The actual behavior of the server depends on the implementation.) When the number of MDB instances handling incoming messages is insufficient, more can be created and added to the pool. − Transitioning to the Method-Ready Pool − When an instance transitions from the Does Not Exist state to the MethodReady Pool, three operations are performed on it. First, the bean instance is instantiated when the container invokes the Class.newInstance( ) method on the MDB class. Second, the setMessageDrivenContext( ) method is invoked by the container providing the MDB instance with a reference to it. d. Write a stateless session bean code to represent BookInformation. (BookId integer, BookName String, Pages integer, Price double). − package bookdemo; import javax.ejb.Stateless; @Stateless public class BookInfo{ private int bookId, pages; private String bookName; private double price MUQuestionPapers.com public BookInfo(){} public void setBookId(int

                        components are written in the Java programming language and compiled in the same way as any Java programming language program. The difference when you work with the Java EE platform, is Java EE components are assembled into a Java EE application, verified that they are well-formed and in compliance with the Java EE specification, and deployed to production where they are run and managed by the Java EE server. Java EE Architecture: Normally, thin-client multitiered applications are hard to write because they involve many lines of intricate code to handle transaction and state management, multithreading, resource pooling, and other complex low-level details. The component-based and platform-independent Java EE architecture makes Java EE applications easy to write because business logic is organized into reusable components and the Java EE server provides underlying services in the form of a container for every component type. Because you do not have to develop these services yourself, you are free to concentrate on solving the business problem at hand. Containers and Services: Component are installed in their containers during deployment and are the interface between a component and the low-level platform-specific functionality that supports the component. Before a web, enterprise bean, or application client component can be executed, it must be assembled into a Java EE application and deployed into its container. The assembly process involves specifying container settings for each component in the Java EE application and for the Java EE application itself. Container settings customize the underlying support provided by the Java EE Server, which include services such as security, transaction management, Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) lookups, and remote connectivity. Here are some of the highlights:  The Java EE security model lets you configure a web component or enterprise bean so system resources are accessed only by authorized users.  The Java EE transaction model lets you specify relationships among methods that make up a single transaction so all methods in one transaction are treated as a single unit. Container Types: The deployment process installs Java EE application components in the following types of Java EE containers.  An Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) container manages the execution of all enterprise beans for one Java EE application. Enterprise beans and their container run on the Java EE server.  A web container manages the execution of all JSP page and servlet components for one Java EE application. Web components and their container run on the Java EE server.  An application client container manages the execution of all application client components for one Java EE application. Application clients and their container run on the client machine.  An applet container is the web browser and Java Plug-in combination running on the client machine.

                        (5) Java EE Containers: Normally, thin-client multitier applications are hard to write because they involve many lines of intricate code to handle transaction and state management, multithreading, resource pooling, and other complex low-level details. The component-based and platform-independent Java EE architecture makes Java EE applications easy to write because business logic is organized into reusable components. In addition, the Java EE server provides underlying services in the form of a container for every component type. Because you do not have to develop these services yourself, you are free to concentrate on solving the business problem at hand. Container Services: Containers are the interface between a component and the low-level platform specific functionality that supports the component. Before a web, enterprise bean, or application client component can be executed, it must be assembled into a Java EE module and deployed into its container. The Java EE security model lets you configure a web component or enterprise bean so that system resources are accessed only by authorized users.  The Java EE transaction model lets you specify relationships among methods that make up a single transaction so that all methods in one transaction are treated as a single unit.  JNDI lookup services provide a unified interface to multiple naming and directory services in the enterprise so that application components can access these services.  The Java EE remote connectivity model manages low-level communications between clients and enterprise beans. After an enterprise bean is created, a client invokes methods on it as if it were in the same virtual machine. Container Types:  Java EE server: The runtime portion of a Java EE product. A Java EE server provides EJB and web containers.  Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) container: Manages the execution of enterprise beans for Java EE applications. Enterprise beans and their container run on the Java EE server.  Web container: Manages the execution of JSP page and servlet components for Java EE applications. Web components and their container run on the Java EE server.  Application client container: Manages the execution of application client components. Application clients and their container run on the client.  Applet container: Manages the execution of applets. Consists of a web browser and Java Plug-in running on the client together. The deployment process installs Java EE application components in the Java EE containers as illustrated in following Figure:

                            (5) JDBC Architecture : The JDBC API supports both two-tier and three-tier processing models for database access but in general, JDBC Architecture consists of two layers • JDBC API: This provides the application-to-JDBC Manager connection. • JDBC Driver API: This supports the JDBC Manager-to-Driver Connection. The JDBC API uses a driver manager and database-specific drivers to provide transparent connectivity to heterogeneous databases. The JDBC driver manager ensures that the correct driver is used to access each data source. The driver manager is capable of supporting multiple concurrent drivers connected to multiple heterogeneous databases. Following is the architectural diagram, which shows the location of the driver manager with respect to the JDBC drivers and the Java application

                        (5) A Servlet can be used with an HTML form tag to allow users to upload files to the server. An uploaded file could be a text file or image file or any document. Creating a File Upload Form: The following HTM code below creates an uploader form. Following are the important points to be noted down –     The form method attribute should be set to POSTmethod and GET method can not be used The form enctype attribute should be set to multipart/form-data The form action attribute should be set to a servlet file which would handle file uploading at backend server. Following example is using UploadServlet servlet to upload file. To upload a single file you should use a single <input .../> tag with attributetype="file". To allow multiple files uploading, include more than oneinput tags with different values for the name attribute. The browserassociates a Browse button with each of them.

                        (5) Expression Language (EL) is mechanism that simplifies the accessibility of the data stored in Java bean component and other object like request, session and application, etc. Immediate Evaluation: All expressions using the ${} syntax are evaluated immediately. These expressions can only be used within template text or as the value of a JSP tag attribute that can accept runtime expressions. The following example shows a tag whose value attribute references an immediate evaluation expression that gets the total price from the session-scoped bean named cart: <fmt:formatNumber value="${sessionScope.cart.total}"/> The JSP engine evaluates the expression, ${sessionScope.cart.total}, converts it,and passes the returned value to the tag handler.Immediate evaluation expressions are always read-only value expressions. The expression shown above can only get the total price from the cart bean; it cannot set the total price. Deferred Evaluation: Deferred evaluation expressions take the form #{expr} and can be evaluated at other phases of a page life cycle as defined by whatever technology is using the expression. In the case of JavaServer Faces technology, its controller can evaluate the expression at different phases of the life cycle depending on how the expression is being used in the page. The following example shows a JavaServer Faces inputText tag, which represents a text field component into which a user enters a value.The inputText tag‟s value attribute references a deferred evaluation expression that points to the name property of the customerbean. <h:inputText id="name" value="#{customer.name}" /> For an initial request of the page containing this tag, the JavaServer Faces implementation evaluates the #{customer.name} expression during the render response phase of the life cycle. During this phase, the expression merely accesses the value of name from the customerbean, as is done in immediate evaluation.

                                (5) Expression Language (EL) is mechanism that simplifies the accessibility of the data stored in Java bean component and other object like request, session and application, etc. Immediate Evaluation: All expressions using the ${} syntax are evaluated immediately. These expressions can only be used within template text or as the value of a JSP tag attribute that can accept runtime expressions. The following example shows a tag whose value attribute references an immediate evaluation expression that gets the total price from the session-scoped bean named cart: <fmt:formatNumber value="${sessionScope.cart.total}"/> The JSP engine evaluates the expression, ${sessionScope.cart.total}, converts it,and passes the returned value to the tag handler.Immediate evaluation expressions are always read-only value expressions. The expression shown above can only get the total price from the cart bean; it cannot set the total price. Deferred Evaluation: Deferred evaluation expressions take the form #{expr} and can be evaluated at other phases of a page life cycle as defined by whatever technology is using the expression. In the case of JavaServer Faces technology, its controller can evaluate the expression at different phases of the life cycle depending on how the expression is being used in the page. The following example shows a JavaServer Faces inputText tag, which represents a text field component into which a user enters a value.The inputText tag‟s value attribute references a deferred evaluation expression that points to the name property of the customerbean. <h:inputText id="name" value="#{customer.name}" /> For an initial request of the page containing this tag, the JavaServer Faces implementation evaluates the #{customer.name} expression during the render response phase of the life cycle.

                        (5) Advantages of JSTL over JSP: 1. Standard Tag: It provides a rich layer of the portable functionality of JSP pages. It's easy for a developer to understand the code. 2. Code Neat and Clean: As scriplets confuse developer, the usage of JSTL makes the code neat and clean. 3. Automatic JavabeansInterospection Support: It has an advantage of JSTL over JSP scriptlets. JSTL Expression language handles JavaBean code very easily. We don't need to downcast the objects, which has been retrieved as scoped attributes. Using JSP scriptlets code will be complicated, and JSTL has simplified that purpose. 4. Easier for humans to read: JSTL is based on XML, which is very similar to HTML. Hence, it is easy for the developers to understand. 5. Easier for computers to understand: Tools such as Dreamweaver and front page are generating more and more HTML code. HTML tools do a great job of formatting HTML code. The HTML code is mixed with the scriplet code. As JSTL is expressed as XML compliant tags, it is easy for HTML generation to parse the JSTL code within the document.

Eg: looping, evaluation of expression and basic input and output. • It contains all the set of tags which are required for writing any JSP. • The URI of the core tag library is: http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core and the prefix is c. • The core area comprises 4 distinct functional sections: • General purpose actions • Conditional actions or flow control statements • Iteration actions • URL related actions Following table lists out the core JSTL Tags – 1.<c:out>:Like <%= ... >, but for expressions. 2.<c:set >:Sets the result of an expression evaluation in a 'scope'

                        (5) An Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) container provides a run-time environment for enterprise beans within the application server. The container handles all aspects of an enterprise bean's operation within the application server and acts as an intermediary between the user-written business logic within the bean and the rest of the application server environment. One or more EJB modules, each containing one or more enterprise beans, can be installed in a single container. The EJB container provides many services to the enterprise bean, including the following: • • • Beginning, committing, and rolling back transactions as necessary. Maintaining pools of enterprise bean instances ready for incoming requests and moving these instances between the inactive pools and an active state, ensuring that threading conditions within the bean are satisfied. Most importantly, automatically synchronizing data in an entity bean's instance variables with corresponding data items stored in persistent storage. By dynamically maintaining a set of active bean instances and synchronizing bean state with persistent storage when beans are moved into and out of active state, the container makes it possible for an application to manage many more bean instances than could otherwise simultaneously be held in the application server's memory. In this respect, an EJB container provides services similar to virtual memory within an operating system. Following work is done by container: • Allocates resources such as threads, sockets and database connections. • Manages the life and death of enterprise beans. • Converts the network less beans into distributed, network aware objects in order to service the remote clients. • Serializes the requests when multiple clients call the methods on a bean‟s instance. • Saves the conversational state of an object between 2 method calls. • Gives security clearance to call a method on the bean. • Manages the transaction of the enterprise bean. • Maintains persistent data by synchronizing the data updates with beans and databases. • Help registering and deploying components.

Following work is done by container: • Allocates resources such as threads, sockets and database connections. • Manages the life and death of enterprise beans. • Converts the network less beans into distributed, network aware objects in order to service the remote clients. • Serializes the requests when multiple clients call the methods on a bean‟s instance. • Saves the conversational state of an object between 2 method calls. • Gives security clearance to call a method on the bean. • Manages the transaction of the enterprise bean. • Maintains persistent data by synchronizing the data updates with beans and databases. • Help registering and deploying components.

                            (5) An Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) container provides a run-time environment for enterprise beans within the application server. The container handles all aspects of an enterprise bean's operation within the application server and acts as an intermediary between the user-written business logic within the bean and the rest of the application server environment. One or more EJB modules, each containing one or more enterprise beans, can be installed in a single container. The EJB container provides many services to the enterprise bean, including the following: • • • Beginning, committing, and rolling back transactions as necessary. Maintaining pools of enterprise bean instances ready for incoming requests and moving these instances between the inactive pools and an active state, ensuring that threading conditions within the bean are satisfied. Most importantly, automatically synchronizing data in an entity bean's instance variables with corresponding data items stored in persistent storage. By dynamically maintaining a set of active bean instances and synchronizing bean state with persistent storage when beans are moved into and out of active state, the container makes it possible for an application to manage many more bean instances than could otherwise simultaneously be held in the application server's memory.

                        (5) EJB is primarily divided into three categories:    Session Beans Message Driven Beans Entity Bean Session Beans: • It is a short-lived object that executes on behalf of a single client. • It is a temporary, logical extension of a client application that runs on the application server. • It can update data. Types of Session Beans • Stateless Session Bean • Stateful Session Bean Stateless session bean It does not remember anything about the client between the calls of the method. It forgets about the client once the business process completes or executes. The bean‟s state has no data regarding a specific client. These are lightweight and provide a high degree of scalability. Since they do not retain the client state, it can be used across multiple clients. Stateful session bean It can remember conversations between the client of the application and the application itself across method calls. They store the data , when a client calls the method again the bean remembers the client‟s previous method call. Only a single client can use a stateful session bean at a time. The state is retained for the duration of the client bean session. Message Driven Beans • It allows enterprise applications to process messages asynchronously. • Is an act as a JMS message listener, which is similar to an event listener except that it receives messages instead of events • The messages may be sent by any component, an application client, another enterprise bean or a web component, a JMS application or system that does not use java EE technology. • Message Driven Beans can consumes JMS messages from external entities and act accordingly. Entity beans Entity beans represent persistent data storage. User data can be saved to database via entity beans and later on can be retrieved from the database in the entity bean.

                        messages. It provides loosely coupled, reliable and asynchronous communication. JMS is also known as a messaging service A message driven bean is like stateless session bean that encapsulates the business logic and doesn't maintain state. Understanding Messaging: Messaging is a technique to communicate applications or software components. JMS is mainly used to send and receive message from one application to another. Requirement of JMS: Generally, user sends message to application. But, if we want to send message from one application to another, we need to use JMS API.

Understanding Messaging: Messaging is a technique to communicate applications or software components. JMS is mainly used to send and receive message from one application to another. Requirement of JMS: Generally, user sends message to application. But, if we want to send message from one application to another, we need to use JMS API.

Resource injection  One of the simplification features of Java EE is the implementation of basic Resource Injection to simplify web and EJB components.  Resource injection enables you to inject any resource available in the JNDI namespace into any container-managed object, such as a servlet, an enterprise bean, or a managed bean. For eg, we can use resource injection to inject data sources, connectors, or any other desired resources available in the JNDI namespace.  The type we‟ll use for the reference to the instance happen to be injected is usually an interface, which would decouple our code from the implementation of the resource. For better understanding of the above statement let‟s take a look at the example.  The resource injection can be performed in the following three ways:  Field Injection  Method Injection  Class injection

                        (5) • • Most business applications require that data must be persistent. Data can be labeled as persistent only when it manages to survive problems such as system crashes and network failures. • As multiple users request for data simultaneously, there is a definite possibility of data getting corrupted, if mid-request, system failure, occurs. • Maintaining the persistence of data in an enterprise wide application is quite a challenging job. • In enterprise application architecture, data persistence is implemented as: • Having data stored outside an application‟s active memory, known as persistent data store, typically a relational database or an object database or a file system. • Having a rollback system, where in case of system failure, the state of the data is rolled back to its last known valid data state. • Persistence is one of the fundamental concepts of application development. • Majority of applications use persistent data. • Hence it is important to choose an appropriate persistence data store. • While choosing the persistence data store the following fundamental pts are considered: • The length of time data must be persisted • The volume of data JPA Versions The first version of Java Persistence API, JPA 1.0 was released in 2006 as a part of EJB 3.0 specification. Following are the other development versions released under JPA specification:  JPA 2.0 - This version was released in the last of 2009. Following are the important features of this version:  It supports validation.  It expands the functionality of object-relational mapping.  It shares the object of cache support.  JPA 2.1 - The JPA 2.1 was released in 2013 with the following features:  It allows fetching of objects.  It provides support for criteria update/delete.  It generates schema.  JPA 2.2 - The JPA 2.2 was released as a development of maintainenece in 2017. Some of its important feature are:  It supports Java 8 Date and Time.  It provides @Repeatable annotation that can be used when we want to apply the same annotations to a declaration or type use.  It allows JPA annotation to be used in meta-annotations.

It provides a framework for mapping an object oriented domain model to a traditional relational database. • It was developed with a goal to relieve developers from 95% of common data persistence related programming tasks by: • Making developers feel as if the database contains plain java objects, without having them worry about how to get them out of / or back into database tables. • Allowing developers to focus on the objects & features of the application, without having worry about how to store them or find them later. • Its primary feature is mapping from: • Java classes to database tables • Java data types to SQL data types • Architecture of Hibernate: • • • • • • Configuration Object: represents a configuration or properties file for hibernate.it is created once during application initialization. It reads the properties to establish a database connection. It is produced to create a session factory. Session Factory: is created with the help of a configuration object during the application start up. It serves as a factory for producing session objects when required. It is created once and kept alive for later use. Session: are lightweight and inexpensive to create. They provide the main interface to perform actual database operations. All the POJOs are saved & retrieved with the help of a session object. Transaction: represents a unit of work with the database. Any kind of modifications initiated via the session object are placed with in a transaction. Session object helps creating a transaction object. Which is used for a short time and are closed by either committing or rejecting. Query: persistence objects are retrieved using a query object. It allow using SQL or HQL queries to retrieve the actual data from the database and create objects. Criteria: persistence objects can also be retrieved using a criteria object. It uses an object/method based means of constructing and executing a request to retrieve objects. Let's see the diagram of hibernate architecture: This is the high level architecture of Hibernate with

                            (5) Hibernate: • • It is the latest open source persistence technology. It provides a framework for mapping an object oriented domain model to a traditional relational database. • It was developed with a goal to relieve developers from 95% of common data persistence related programming tasks by: • Making developers feel as if the database contains plain java objects, without having them worry about how to get them out of / or back into database tables. • Allowing developers to focus on the objects & features of the application, without having worry about how to store them or find them later. • Its primary feature is mapping from: • Java classes to database tables • Java data types to SQL data types • Architecture of Hibernate: • • • • • • Configuration Object: represents a configuration or properties file for hibernate.it is created once during application initialization. It reads the properties to establish a database connection. It is produced to create a session factory. Session Factory: is created with the help of a configuration object during the application start up. It serves as a factory for producing session objects when required. It is created once and kept alive for later use. Session: are lightweight and inexpensive to create. They provide the main interface to perform actual database operations. All the POJOs are saved & retrieved with the help of a session object. Transaction: represents a unit of work with the database. Any kind of modifications initiated via the session object are placed with in a transaction. Session object helps creating a transaction object. Which is used for a short time and are closed by either committing or rejecting. Query: persistence objects are retrieved using a query object. It allow using SQL or HQL queries to retrieve the actual data from the database and create objects. Criteria: persistence objects can also be retrieved using a criteria object. It uses an object/method based means of constructing and executing a request to retrieve objects.

An EntityManager object helps creating an EntityTransaction object. These objects are typically used for a short time and are closed by either committing or rejecting. Query: • Persistence objects are retrieved using a query object. It allows using SQL or JPQL queries to retrieve the actual data from the database and create objects. Criteria: • Criteria API is a non-string-based API for the dynamic construction of object-based queries. • Criteria query objects are passed to the EntityManager‟s createQuery() method to create query objects and then executed using the methods of Query API. The above classes and interfaces are used for storing entities into a database as a record. They help programmers by reducing their efforts to write codes for storing data into a database so that they can concentrate on more important activities such as writing codes for mapping the classes with database tables.
